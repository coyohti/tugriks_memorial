Quiet Grove(#44273RLJ)
     All is green and quiet here in the grove; a deep tranquility where
the sighing of the wind and the occasional chirp of a bird emphasize the
peacefulness of the place.
    The center of the grove is a lea of bright emerald grasses.  Tall
trees line its perimeter.  In the exact center is a round stone slab
perhaps 2 feet in diameter where a memorial candle might be placed to 
offer the light of rememberance for a lost friend.
    Small lights wink in the green leaves overhead.

DanielCervus speaks with a bit , "seems we have a few new guests?"
Tannahill is having problems tracking conversations 'cause he went idle for 6 minutes, so *that's* just like the old days!

Purrip hugs Tannahill!
Corwyn has arrived.
Garmon purrs, "Do we know what is going to happen to Purrsia? I know that Faux Pas is already moving their archives."
Purrip tackles Tannahill!
Arcturax chirps, "I didn't know Tugrik till a few years ago, but I knew of him.  He was on a few telegram channels I'm on and he ran a cooking channel where a bunch of us shared recipes."
Chiaroscuro says, "As things are shortly to begin, It would be best if we could draw general conversation to a steady close. There are many folks here and it will be difficult to focus otherwise. I know we all wish to regreet long-missed friends, and there surely will be time for that."
Sebkha has arrived.
Tannahill hugs Purrip. Still obviously the same hyena, just with fewer spots and more gray fur.
Peggy says, "Oh that's good to hear, Shaterri, he ended up hosting my friend's band's site even though it's not furry in the least.""
Tilead winghugs Arcturax
JackRabbitson says, "Daci should be happy to hear that"

>> Walenka waddles in, her luscious fur flowing on her jiggling flesh.
Kaliffio duly does his thing where he picks up his hooves and just floats in midair as if sitting in an invisible chair.

Kahlim has arrived.
Lux_Aeterna hugs Kahlim!
DanielCervus nods to the crowd.
Kamen_Kyote cannot remember half the commands though he RPs here privately every night.
Axiom smiles and waves to Gilead. Another name it's been too long since he's seen.
Hatch says, "I still remember road tripping to Chicago with Tug to check out Virtual World and play the Battletech simulators.  Good times.  Hard to believe what's possible now.  We dreamed about stuff like VR Chat and etc."
Bandit has arrived.
Garmon purrs, ""I have already done the double-quote thing once. (Demonstrates)""
Drew says, "OK, folks. It's now time. Please bring all external conversations to a close, and please allow folks to speak without unecessary chatter."
K'has says, "I'm going to give it twominutes and then we will start."
Kaliffio says, "I still have my Cedarcon keychain somewhere...""
Quilrynn zips up, accordingly.
Zrath-Smiley gives Hatch a lil' hug. "Hey SKWRL."
Woulfe has arrived.
>>   Funrir Woulfe takes a step into the area, being careful not to hurt anyone down on the ground below him, tip-toeing around on his vast foot-paws lightly
Jean-Renaud adjusts his tie, clearing his throat
Shania nods, thanks everyone for the welcome.
Dronon sits up.

K'has steps up to the podium.  "Thank you, all of you, for coming.
Revar has arrived.
Hrral hugs Kratsminsch!  Kratsminsch hugs Hrral back, surreptitiously stuffing his pockets with assorted candies and currencies.
Kratsminsch nods to revar
Axiom sits quietly beside Cargie.
Anthony nods to Revar also.
Miell settles down.
Austin has arrived.
_Austin's_Tail has arrived.
_Austin's_Tail follows Austin, as one might expect.
Drew nods to Revar, then motions to K'has for a preamble.
K'has says, ""It's interesting how certain phrases will seemingly show up in a time of grief and crisis..."My heart has joined the Thousand, for my friend stopped running today."
Kzintosh has connected.
K'has says, "And I felt that way when I learned that Tug had died."
Kzintosh has disconnected.
Hella nods at K'has's words.
K'has says, "  It's hard to say goodbye to someone who was so influential in the early days of Furry Fandom and in Furrymuck itself.  He was an amazing man, involved in some spectacular art cars at Burning Man and ran one of the few Furry nodes on Fidonet,  Lynx and others have passed along details of his life to Jack Rabbitson and an article on Tug and his impact on Furry (and on the world) will be in an upcoming issue of Flayrah.  Dronon is also collecting stories... please talk to him as well."
Dragon has arrived.
Dronon points to 'small note' in the room, which has contact info
K'has says, "I hope that all of you will read one of the memorials...he was truly remarkableand gave so much to the world."
K'has says, "In addition, I would like to pass along condolences from the Dorsai Irregulars. He was well known to many of us and well-liked."
Guest3 has arrived.
K'has says, "As is traditional with our memorial services here on FurryMuck, some of the wizards will say a few words and then I'll open it up to individuals.  Please avoid public poses and comments until after each speaker finishes."
K'has says, "The order of speakers is : Drew,Lynx, Gryph, Chip_unicorn, Sigmon  Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
K'has nods to Drew...go ahead.
Drew eases up. 
Drew says, "My first introduction to Tugrik was face-to-face, as it was in the mid-1990's and such things were as common in person at conventions than doing so online."
Drew says, "Tugrik's player is, with no exaggeration, a huge individual. If I were looking at Stoick from "How To Train Your Dragon", I'd say they based the character off Tori. Of course, "How To Train Your Dragon" was about fifteen years after this."
Electra has arrived.
Pyat has arrived.
Drew says, "Nearly two meters of broad, heavy, happy Viking, with flame-red hair that cascaded down his back from a mohawk in front strode up to me and offered a hand that looked like it was going to swallow mine. He was a massive presence, and was yet the happiest, gentlest sort your could imagine. "
StephenQuoll has arrived.
Drew says, "Meeting Tugrik was an exercise in watching someone who pointed themselves in a direction, and turned all the jets on. Tugrik did things with full effort, regardless if it was work, hobbies, or play. When FurryMUCK needed a new home, he jumped at it, and was the force behind the scenes for the past twenty-five years. Between him running the server and Revar (his roommate) writing the code, I could not have asked for a better dynamic duo."
Drew says, "While I know I could go into other things Tugrik did, I think those are better left for others to describe, but FurryMUCK was just a slice of everything going on with Tugrik, a slice I am very grateful for him to have handled."

The sleepers here are sabina, Tugrik, and Cerilus.
The puppets here are _Austin's_Tail, Zorin's Tail, and Cream.
Drew pauses, having to collect himself, and all his arms shudder for a moment. "Keep galumphing out there in the Happy hunting Grounds, Big Blue."
Drew bows his head, and steps back. "Next."
Lynx hugs the Drew. "Well said."
Maxie nods in agreement.
Raoul has arrived.
Lynx purrs, "While I was one of those who visited Tugrik in the Midwest for Cedarcon--it was exciting for a doesn't-get-around-much Lynx to take one of the very few plane trips he's ever made--I remember him best for how welcoming he and his friends were in the Bay Area in the 90s. We'd get together frequently to hang out, visit a restaurant and have good food--he and Revar introduced me to *actually spicy Chinese food* which was a revelation. He was always excited to show off new things he'd been working on, or we'd get together to watch the latest Babylon 5 episode. That's the Tug I'll remember going forward."
Gryph has connected.
Hatch nods.  Well said Drew.
Lynx purrs, "On the wizardly/server administration side of things, he's been a gracious host there as well for so many people. It's thanks to him that I drew the inspiration and courage to get my own Linux box and domain for a stable email address, rather than relying on whichever ISP I happened to land on. (remember the days of AOL and Netcom?)"
Lynx purrs, "I don't have a lot of sketches of him online, though I imagine Tugrik had one or two in those con sketchbooks--remember them? But apparently I did scan one labeled "Faire sketches: Tug's desired costume" which I'm guessing means I drew it while we were at a RenFaire: http://lynx.purrsia.com/private/tugcostume.jpg "
Lynx purrs, "And that's it from me."
K'has says, "The order of speakers is : Gryph, Chip_unicorn, Sigmon, Kaliffo, Tannahill, Tricuspa , Zorin, Hella, Peggy  Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Mike has arrived.
K'has says, "Gryph's connecion is shaky.  Chip?"
Elly has connected.
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "I worked with Tugrik for many years here."
Gryph has disconnected.
Gryph says, "I have been popping in and out of connection here, appropriately enough, because of things Tug could have probably easily fixed. <chuckle>"
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "He brought me in here, guided my first months as a wizard, and helped me understand the responsibilities here."
Sodium has arrived.
Elly has disconnected.
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "I have been lucky enough to meet him a few times in real life. He was literally bigger than life in so many ways."
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "I appreciate the care that he took to protect users' privacy. "
Shanya has arrived.
Quiet Grove(#44273RLJ)
     All is green and quiet here in the grove; a deep tranquility where
the sighing of the wind and the occasional chirp of a bird emphasize the
peacefulness of the place.
    The center of the grove is a lea of bright emerald grasses.  Tall
trees line its perimeter.  In the exact center is a round stone slab
perhaps 2 feet in diameter where a memorial candle might be placed to 
offer the light of rememberance for a lost friend.
    Small lights wink in the green leaves overhead.

Crissa has arrived.
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "So very many companies could have learned from him. I learned the vital importance of separations of concerns from him -- and a lot about handling security WELL."
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "He enjoyed life to the fullest, sought out what he wanted with laser-like focus, and went for that."
HillBluffer has arrived.
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "I visited his place in San Jose a few times; he visited me when I lived in Seattle."
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "And... I will deeply miss his strength and his deep love for this community."
Gryph hell yeahs to Chip.
Axiom softly wagpiffs Chip.
Chip_Unicorn walks to the center stone slab, and places a lit candle on it. "Run free, Big Bloo."
D'anna has arrived.
K'has says, "Gryph, since your connection is back..."
Cats has disconnected.
K'has says, "The order of speakers is :Sigmon, Kaliffo, Tannahill, Tricuspa , Zorin, Hella, Peggy, Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw  Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
StormyDragon has arrived.
Sigwion nods and steps up, trying to organize some notes just scribbled.
Cats has connected.
Sigwion says, "Hello... I'm Sigwion, just some random kid who wandered on here two decades ago. Please excuse the rust and syntax. "
Sigwion says, "I didn't know the person Tugrik as well as many of you seem to, but there is a sense of profound gratitude nonetheless. Because of that randomness, and not knowing better, I feel it helps represent not simply who Tugrik was but what he left us: a place of community."
Sigwion says, "When I arrived, the sudden fall followed by Bigears hugging me sent my mind into a panic. This weird little ham-radio text-game thing suddenly felt like people and not just a "thing". As I struggled to figure out how to even walk, there was no lack of patience and respect given to me by complete strangers. This feeling, just being accepted, was alien to me at the time. No trick or game... just, welcome. I immeaditately logged off for a week. Yet... when I returned nothing changed. It was "real"."
Sigwion says, "Over the next year I started undertanding more and more about this world, and that is when I figured out what a "Wiz" was. Having poor judgement and little inhibition, I ended up contacting the top of the list at the time. Something called "Tugrik". "
Sigwion says, "Being a bit of a outcast, you can tell a lot about a person by their choice of words. Phrasing, context, pacing, notation... and when Tugrik patiently helped me set my flags it hit me. This world, FurryMUCK, sounded like him. A loud yet calm, warm and welcome bellow."
Sigwion says, "I would contact them alot after that, maybe too much to be honest, but they were always there. I will miss him. A lot."
Voksa has arrived.
Drew drops A picture of Tugrik.
Sigwion nods "Thank you..."
Zrath-Smiley says, "Hear hear!"
K'has says, "The order of speakers is:  Kaliffo, Tannahill, Tricuspa , Zorin, Hella, Peggy, Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar  Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Contrast has arrived.
Drew sets down a small picture of tugrik, for folks to have a visual reference of Big Bloo.
K'has nods to Kaliffo.  
Hella speaks, "So say we all!"
Taldin (aka Kaliffio) grins sheepishly as he breaks a long silence.  "Hey. Tug and I go waaaay back, ever since he was excited to meet another blue unicorn.  He used to call me his little brother or 'little Blue' to his 'big Bloo', and Cedarcon was where he facilitated me meeting my then-partner Ehlana for the first time, along with a bunch of folks who had only been names on a screen in ASCII text. He actually followed me out to California, and was my downstairs neighbor for awhile in San Jose; before he got into gourmet stuff, he used to burn things not-on-purpose.  But if you had to ask me for one memory I'll never forget, it's the household that he opened to everyone, anyone, and there was always something cool and new to see.  He gave his whole heart to anyone who walked in his door, and he taught me how to dance again, when I'd forgotten how.  And in case nobody rememebers... there's a Hoffmanite in Buck Godot, Zap Gun For Hire modeled after him because Phil Foglio said "Stop! I need to draw you!"   
Lianna has arrived.
Taldin says, "Thank you for being here for me through all my travels, near and far, and never wondering when I'd come back again.  Thank you for being there when I needed you the most, and keeping my secrets when I had nobody else to tell.  And thank you for pizza, music, and Sweet Thunder the most, in the frigid winter of Kalamazoo.  For listening to my woes over relationships come and gone, more than once.  For being the person who kept telling me that the door was always open, even though I rarely took it later in our journeys apart."
Taldin nods at the silent big Blue.  "Well, old friend, you said you weren't sure people would care to remember you, and yet... we're here.  I miss you, and I'm sorry I never took up your offer to come visit or go to Tokyo with you, but it was never the right time.  And... know that your dance and your song and your starlight live on even as you go to dust, as you told me to say when this day came.  I'm here.  The words are done, and said, and... Run True, old friend. I can't follow you yet, but I know where to look when I do."  He bows his head and goes silent, offering a horn clack to a ghost of a shell that is one with the cosmos.
Kaliffio says, "...I always used to say 'Until' when we parted.  And that day will never come again this lifetime."
Kaliffio says, "..thank you."
K'has says, "The order of speakers is:  annahill, Tricuspa , Zorin, Hella, Peggy, Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Purrip hugs Tannahill!
K'has says, "Tannahill..."
Tannahill noses the nekorisu, and starts. "Thanks."
Electra peeks at and hugs at a Tannahill too.
Zrath-Smiley hugs Electra!
Thera has arrived.
Electra hugs Zrath-Smiley and Quilrynn and SpotWeld and Yiffette.
Manitou has arrived.
Electra settles down quietly.
Tannahill says, "Okay, this is RL Tug I wanted to bring up, since he did a billion things. One of those billion was; for a while there, I and my ex couldn't keep our cats with us, and Tug and Revar were kind enough to let our cats stay with them, and let us visit as well, which was great! But on top of just being kind enough to let the cats stay there for a while, I'll always remember Tugrik as being incredibly kind and indulgent to them. People who're that kind to cats score *real* high in my world. That's basically it, for me."
Tannahill faces the monoceros, silently for a moment, and goes back to his place in the crowd.
K'has nods to Gryph...maybe his connection is stable now?
Gryph says, "Thank you.  I'll be brief because there are better people than me here to speak their hearts.  There will always be parking space for Tug at High Flight.  Tug was a housemate for a while at our villa strangiata in Oklahoma.  This was back when I first got traction as a writer.  Misty and I adored him.  We put little cameos of FurryMuck people in our books, including Chrome Circle where Furhold--an homage to FurryMuck--first appeared.  I see many of those people here tonight.  Tug joined us in some of our early rescues.  He had one of those awesome Honda PCX-style scooters, which he rode as a single seater.   I wish he was here to witness all of us together after so many years.  This isn't graceful or inspiring like a sacred eulogy or anything, this is just me saying the way it is.  I have a big blue hole in my heart right now and these tears will last a while.  We miss you buddy.  We fucking well miss you."
K'has says, "The order of speakers is:  Tricuspa , Zorin, Hella, Peggy, Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Gryph says, "That's all."
Tricuspa steps up.
Tricuspa says melodiously, ""My words come mostly from Feefers: 'I  more interacted with his partner Revar but yeah Tugrik was one of the most amazing people i can think of.'"
Elly has disconnected.
Tricuspa says melodiously, "'There's this cool xkcd comic where it has a pillar that pretty much the entire internet relies on and i always thought of Tugz as one of the people that kept that pillar shiny and clean and the world will be a gloomier place without him.'"
Tricuspa says melodiously, "As for me I really wish Tugrik is with all the folks he enjoyed in the past, those who are also no longer with us and they are enjoying the social network of eternity, while having a loving community, much like the one he helped all of us create here.  Take care blue monocerous! Thank you all."
Tricuspa Steps down
Corwyn says, "Well said."
Prismo has arrived.
K'has says, "The nexxt speaker is:  Zorin,  --followed by  Hella, Peggy, Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege.

Crissa falls into a deep sleep... And will be autoswept in 20 minutes
Crissa has connected.
Crissa wakes and yawns
Zorin steps up to the front and nods to everyone, "I didn't know Tugrik too well on a personal level. But when I was a young 17 year old new to the furry fandom, and new to FurryMUCK, with an extremely high level of enthusiasm that was quite annoying to other furs, Tugrik was the one who pulled me aside and told me my behavior was putting off others on the MUCK. And he did it in a way that got through to me. No punishment, just kind words to someone who didn't know the ropes yet."
Crissa has disconnected.
Crissa falls into a deep sleep... And will be autoswept in 20 minutes
Guest4 has arrived.
Zorin purrs, "Over the next few weeks I was learning how to build and he helped me figure it out, and I soon got to know him as someone who loved providing a place for community. He loved being behind the scenes building infrastructure. He became a role model as I enjoyed doing that too, albeit to a smaller extent."
Guest4 quietly takes a seat.
Crissa has connected.
Crissa wakes and yawns
Zorin purrs, "I've since learned he's done so many amazing things of that nature outside of the MUCK too and was an incredible talent. The world is a lesser place without you, Tug. "
Cinnibar has arrived.
Zorin nods, "Thank you all" before heading back down.
K'has says, "The nexxt speaker is Hella--followed by  Peggy, Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."

Guest1 has left.
Zrath-Smiley squeezes Hella's hand, then lets go.
Hella nods to K'khas, stands up, approaching the podium and she she looks to the gathered crowd. "Woohhf, more people here than we have normally, but I think Tuggers would be happy to see we've call come here for him. Probably surprised, especially the more vulpine amongst you," she chuckles, bringing up the old WCOTP cliches.
Chip_Unicorn has connected.
Chip_Unicorn has disconnected.
Hella continues, her expression returning to a more sombre one. "I didn't know him outside of the MUCK like some of you, only knew him here. Where he was always ready with that big shaggy blue fur for a cuddle, and a rumble like those motorcycles he seems to have enjoyed," she gives a sad chuckle. "But as others have said, said. His legacy isn't in just him, but this place he built up and cultivated and cared for," she nods over at everyone assembled. "Where we've all come together to meet people, people we care for. To get to know, a lot of 'em from all the way across the world." 
Hella gives a sad little smile. "For that, for knowing him as I did, I'm grateful for that." She squares her shoulders back, "Just wish I'd gotten to know him longer, but...he touched us all for the time that he was with us. I'm sad that he's gone, but I'm happy he's at peace." She moves over to lights a candle, passing by the big shaggy blue body and petting through Tugrik's mane, ruffling it affectionatly. "So long, and thanks for all the fish, Big Blue." She lays a kiss on his horn and returns to her place in the crowd.
Hella squeezes Zrath's hand, on her return to his side.
Judas has arrived.
Gryph has disconnected.
K'has says, "The nexxt speaker is Peggy--followed by  , Flossi, Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Peggy nods at K'has. She walks to the podium, leans on it, and sighs. She's clearly been crying. 
Gryph has connected.
Nyuni has arrived.
Peggy tales out some notes and squints at them. "This has been hitting me a lot harder than it feels like it should. We weren't close. Scened a few times. Chatted here and there on the social networks after they took over. Flirted a little now and then."
Guest2 has arrived.
Peggy says, "He and Revar dragged me to Burning Man once. That was an experience I'd have never had otherwise as a broke-ass animation student, that's for sure."
Peggy says, "When I had a gallery exhibition later on, he leapt at the chance to use one of his newest toys to help me out: a giant printer in his workshop. They came out amazing; he dove into the mysteries of color correction the way he did so many other technologies. I've still got a few other pieces of my art he printed for me hanging on my walls. I'm pretty grateful for that."
Tilead suddenly looks suprised
Wesley has arrived.
Peggy says, "I lost contact with him when Twitter went to shit. I figured I'd run into him again, hear another crazy story like the time an overheard conversation in a cafe lead to him building out an entire server farm for Netflix's first venture into streaming. (I might be mixing up two stories here. He was a crazy-ass wandering hacker ronin.) Maybe get to hang at the Lair-On-Stilts after some convention brought me back out to the West Coast. But, well." She pauses and wipes her eyes. "Here we are. "
Peggy puts a hand on Tugrik's mane. "I'm gonna be thinking of you the next few times it storms. Just gonna go outside and watch the rain come down and bundle up all my memories of you and send them up into the lightning-filled sky, to go... wherever they need to go next. Hope to see you in the next life, Big Blue. Whether as acquaintance or more. May the storms take you somewhere wonderful."
Wulfebyte has arrived.
Peggy smiles. "Thanks for everything, Tug." And then she takes her seat again.
Hella nods somberly at the finality of that 'well here we are'.
K'has says, "The nexxt speaker is Flossi,--followed by  Shaterri, Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Ashryn gives Peggy a gentle shoulder nudge.
Flossi says, "I wasn't as close to Tugrik as many of you, and only met him in person a couple of times. Mostly I knew him through interactions here and on social media. But in these past few days I've been thinking about a private conversation we had."
Tilead hugs Peggy
Flossi says, "Tugrik was deeply worried that he was putting on a mask to his friends and hiding parts of himself. He was much more of a quiet introvert than I think a lot of people knew. "
Flossi says, "He never sought the popularity he had, and really just wanted to pursue his hobbies and have fun with friends. To be inventive in the things that intrigued him. To pursue some interests for a time and then move onto some new hobby. "
Flossi says, "But he had a kind heart, and he kept giving what he could back to the fandom and his community. Sometimes doing far too much than he really should have, and exceeding his own reserves."
Flossi says, "And then when it came time he retired and moved away, to focus on himself, and he deserved to be able to do so."
Flossi says, "I wish there was more time for him to have to himself. Bye Tugrik."
K'has says, "The nexxt speaker is Shaterri,--followed by   Points, Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Gryph has disconnected.
Gryph has connected.
StephenQuoll says, "Michi/Insomnia is having a hard time emotionally and is unable to be here but wishes to send hugs"
Hella staples Gryph's connection down, or tries to..
Keiko has disconnected.
Gryph says, "Thanks SQ."
Shaterri breathes deep. "I wasn't expecting to cry. I've been telling people all week that the news hadn't really hit me yet. But this gathering has brought all of it on at once. There's little I can say about Tugrik that won't be better said by other folks here, but there are just a couple of things that struck me."
Guest3 has disconnected.
Guest3 has left.
Shaterri says, "One is that Tug was someone who put his pride into the things that he _did_, not the things that he had. The latter were just tools to do things with - more often than not for other peoples's sake."
Shaterri says, "And the other is that it's testament to the breadth of his influence and the sheer scope of his life that over the last week I've constantly learned new things about someone I knew for more than thirty years."
Shaterri says, "It's hard to imagine a world that doesn't have him in it. And that's really all I can say. Thank you."
Guest1 has arrived.
Points hugs Shaterri tight on his way up.
"The nexxt speaker is   Points," K'has says, "--followed by  Micole, Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege.

Axiom hugs Shaterri.
Endy has arrived.
Cargie hugs Shaterri!  Shaterri looks fairly startled, but hugs back tightly.
Endy quietly sits with Lochiel.
Zrath-Smiley snugs Endy!
Micole chirps, "hugs Shaterri!"
Hella hugs Endy!
Endy snug! Zraffs, glad he figured out how to be here.
Points quietly says, "Though I'd known and chatted with Tug many a time, it is thanks to Revar that I truly got to know him on a more personal level.  I admit, I wrote the fixed point math into the server as a pure lark, and because I wanted to do matrix math in MUF... but my inside joke truly turned into so much more."
Indi has arrived.
Points quietly says, "That evening in San Jose, we all talked food, code, audio equipment, networking gear, hot tubs, house repair... Truthfully, I can't even recall where all our conversations wandered."
Drew pats Shaterri with one arm gently.
Points nods behind his player, "My den amp still has his name on it.  I sent him my old electrostatic speakers, because he was fascinated with their response profile.  Just, lots of randomness over the years."
Matrian has arrived.
Crissa has disconnected.
Crissa falls into a deep sleep... And will be autoswept in 20 minutes
Points quietly says, "Yet there was so much more we shared as well.  We discussed goals.  Fears.  How the world saw us as individuals, as a community - how we acted upon that."
Revar twitches... "Well, I suppose there re worse languages to do math in.  Like maybe Intercal."
Points winks at Revar.
Peggy stifles giggles.
StephenQuoll says, "That's the worst language to do /anything/ in"
Zorin purrs, "PLEASE no. :)"
Flossi says, "You're gonna make me remember programming in MUMPS."
K'has smiles,but signals for quiet
Points quietly says, "Tug had his own demons, his own worries and many dreams.  For all his larger than life, he was more human than any three people I know.  That's a compliment, despite the pulpit here."
Shaterri says, "Folks, please hold the conversation. We still have many speakers yet."
Drew ahems soiftly, and motions for folks to keep the chatter down, please.
Jeffkun has arrived.
Crissa has connected.
Crissa wakes and yawns
Points quietly says, "He drove across the country and stayed with me out here for a couple of days.  My daughter still remembers him - despite the intevening years.  He spent a few hours building brick towers with her, and then playing his own verison of a blig bloo monster knocking them down again.  I have pictures."
Points quietly says, "I deeply regret not being able to find the time to accept his invitation for us all to return to see him on the West Coast.  There was always tomorrow, and things would be a bit better.  Now there is no more tomorrow, but I will continue to hold those other times close."
Points quietly says, "Thank you."
K'has says, "The next speaker is  Micole,--followed by   Tilead, Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Hella chuckles 'big bloo monster' indeed.
DanielCervus smiles.
Dronon has disconnected.
Dronon has connected.
Siege shuffles, curling her tail around her legs
Shaterri says, "Micole seems to have fallen idle. Tilead, perhaps?"
Sigwion adjusts his sitting position.
Tilead looks up
K'has says, "Tilead,go ahead"
Vincaesula has arrived.
Kratsminsch hugs Vincaesula!
Vincaesula hugs round
Zrath-Smiley hugs Vincaesula!
Micole chirps, "I cant see what I'm tyo"
Vel has disconnected.
Micole chirps, "PLEASE STOP"
Hatch hugs Micole tight.
Tilead says, "thanks K'has. I never met Tugrik in person, though every day since I met him I wish I had. I truly don't remember which friend I met him through, but he always seemed to be in the background of every good part of furry that I came across. We mostly talked about cooking and food, and I was struck by the fact that even while he was ill he showed such a zest for fun and life and small things in the lives of his friends, and people he'd never met. I hope that we get to chat someday. *lights a candle, sits back down*"
K'has says, "We're working on helping Micole, so I will callfor the next speaker"
K'has says, "The next speaker is  Jareth,--followed by  Jareth, Magnavixen, Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Jareth says, "I ve known Tugrik a long time, though I didn t get to spend nearly as much time with him as he deserved. That s on me, because every time I *did* reach out he was all smiles, welcoming and cheerful and supportive. "
Jareth says, "I remember visiting his place back when he lived in San Jose. There was always a crowd, yet I never felt ignored or out-of-place. There was one time in particular that keeps jumping out to me: he was getting ready for Burning Man and he d build a device that would shine a laser into the sky, predicting satellite flares. Learning about that tech is what eventually led to me getting into astrophotography."
Jareth says, "He inspired me get into ham radio, too; that knowledge (and his call-sign) featured in one of my novels. When I got into landscape photography, I reached out to ask about lenses and lighting. IIRC, he s the person who talked me into giving a mac laptop a try, back when I was just getting started in IT/software development/QA. I m still using a MacbookPro today. I m pretty sure he s the person who convinced to look up Arduino chips, too."
Jareth says, "Every time I spoke to him, no matter how long it d been since we d seen each other, he smiled and treated me like a friend. He made me feel welcome. He inspired me to *try*, and that s carried over to so many aspects of my life."
Jareth says, "I m not sure if I ever told him how much *better* my life was because he was a part of it. But then, I m just one of many; he helped so, so many people. That s a hell of a legacy."
Corwyn says, "Best legacy."
Argentilane has arrived.
Mike says, "Just real quick, Torrle asked me to send well-wishes from F-list."
Jareth says, "So, I guess that's really what I wanted to say: Tug, where every you are...Thank you. "
K'has nods
Luagha has arrived.
"The next speaker is  Magnavixen," K'has says, "--followed by  Zrath-Smiley, Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Magnavixen stands and walks up, taking a deep breath, shuddering a bit. Then makes a soft chuckle before she begins to speak.
Magnavixen says, "Tugrik and I fucked."
Magnavixen says, "VR, not RL. I was never fortunate enough to cross paths with him in person; the time we had become friends was also the time RL troubles would not let either of us visit. But friends we were, and as happens on FurryMUCK sometimes friends have something more in this virtual space. And Tugrik was an appreciative, appreciated something more for a  vixen. His sweet nature made me feel appreciated and cherished, and I know I am not the only one. There is furry art out there of a monoceros and his escapades. Some of us have seen them, some lucky few of us are in them."
DanielCervus gasps.
Magnavixen says, "It was part of his friendship and good nature to draw people in, and I do wish we had entered each other's orbit earlier. We had wonderful conversations, especially when he learned I cooked for a licing. Once he recommended a tabletop fryer to me.. and then when I dithered about buying it, he simply purchased it on my behalf. I did my best to mention to him whenever I cooked with it. He will be greatly missed. And part of what I will miss is a monoceros trying to knock up a middle-aged vixen. He was sexual and damn sexy, and that is a part of him that deserves mention as much as the rest as we try to remember all of him. _Riposa In Pace_, Big Bloo."
Magnavixen gazes at the still monoceros, pats his horn ever so softly, and sits back down.
K'has nods.
K'has says, "The next speaker is  Zrath-Smiley,--followed by  Hatch, Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi. Please whisper me if you'd like to say a few words."
Zrath-Smiley gathers himself and steps up. "I wasn't planning on saying anything but, you know, it's Tug." The Kzin grins. "This will be off the cuff, and there might be some swearing."
Rose has left.
Zrath-Smiley says, "The first time I met Tugrik in RL, I thought to myself, "Oh putain, c'est Ob lix!". Which roughly translates to "Holy shit, it's Obelix!". We were the same height (TALL!), but he was much rounder and could have easily cosplayed as the famous Gaulish menhir maker and friend to Ast rix. He was larger than life in many ways, a kind giving soul. He was sometimes taken for granted, and had to learn to pull back. I would see him at conventions and he always had cool stuff with him."
Guest4 has disconnected.
Guest4 has left.
Zrath-Smiley says, "He was a Maker before it was cool and all these Maker Faires started popping up. He was into drones before they were cool. He was a tech pioneer, getting the newest stuff and playing with it, finding its limitations, and putting it all to good use. Towards the end, when his body was failing him, the Apple Vision Pro allowed him to continue using computers and communicate."
Zrath-Smiley says, "I am eternally thankful for this community he contributed so much to, this FurryMUCK. We all are. I'm here every single night. All my friends are here." The Kzin shivers. "I had a nightmare once where my computer was taken away and I remember shouting, "NO! You can't do that! All my friends are in there!". And you know what, it's so fucking true! This place is the only thing keeping me sane these days. I am terrified at the prospect of losing it."
Zrath-Smiley ear-flattens and clears his throat. "Sorry, that took a turn. His passing and this memorial have really gotten to me. Tugrik was awesome, pure and simple. It's a testament to his awesomeness that so many people gathered here tonight and shared their memories of Gros Bleu (Big Blue). He will be greatly missed."
DanielCervus sighs.
Zrath-Smiley turns to face the monoceros and salutes. "Adieu mon fr re, et merci." He turns and walks back to Hella's side.
Hella does laugh after reading Magnavixen's delightfully blunt remark, and grins. She nods to Zrath's words, as well. She gathers Zrath into a warm tight hug.
Mzimu lights a candle, he must depart too early.
Mzimu teleports away.
Mzimu has left.
K'has thanks you with a quiet nod.  "The next speaker is   Hatch,--followed by  Lux Aeterna, Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa.
Dronon touches Zrath lightly on the shoulder. "Restez fort. Ton ame brille ce soir."
Zrath-Smiley hugs Hella tight, ears flat.
Hatch stands up.
Hella claps Zrath on the arm and cozies on up against the space-tigger.
Hatch says, "First, let me say a big thank you to K'has, Drew and everyone who helped put this event together.  I'm not a great storyteller or speaker, but I'm going to give this my best effort."
Hatch says, "Tugrik and I met back when we both were in our late teens back in Michigan.  We were both into the local BBS scene and big computer nerds, with a massive fondness for the old Amiga platform."
Chareth has connected.
Chareth has disconnected.
Hatch says, "Tug is the one who introduced me to the internet, furry, and so much more.  Our circles of friends overlapped almost entirely back then.  We hosted crazy gatherings like CedarCon, and got into all kinds of trouble together over the years.  So many hazy memories."
Kassidey goes home.
Kassidey has left.
Hatch says, "Sometimes we clashed, but we always remained friends.  Back then we were like brothers.  When we both left Michigan the distance and years got between us.  We crossed paths less often, but I never forgot my friend and I know he never forgot me either because that's just the kind of guy Tugrik was.  He was everyone's friend, and the number of people here tonight proves that beyond any doubt."
Ashtoreth has arrived.
Gryph has connected.
Hatch says, "I would not be the person I am today if I'd never met my friend Tor, and I hope he knew that.  Knowing him changed me for the better.  Wherever he is now, I hope he's doing what he loves.  I'm gonna miss ya Bloo.  I wish we'd had more time to reconnect."
Hatch places a mix CD of favorite songs from days gone by next to the monument.  "See ya on the other side.  Put a good word in for me."
Hatch sits back down and rests his face in his hands.
K'has nods quietly.  "The next speaker is  Lux Aeterna, --followed by  Twopaw, Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa.
Zrath-Smiley squeezes Hatch's shoulder. "I didn't know you guys went back that far. That's awesome."

Lux_Aeterna barks, ""So many people here knew Tugrik in real life, and so many more were close to him here in FurryMuck. I regret that I can not say the same.""
Guest2 has arrived.
Lux_Aeterna barks, "When the news came out, Garmon said to me that he probably only spoke to Tug directly half a dozen times, and the same is pretty much true for me as well, and that, mainly wizrd questions."
Crissa has disconnected.
Crissa falls into a deep sleep... And will be autoswept in 20 minutes
Crissa has connected.
Crissa wakes and yawns
Lux_Aeterna barks, "Tugrik was unfailingly kind and generous and helpful, and we all know that he made this world that we love what it is."
Lux_Aeterna barks, "But I wanted to especially mention Mark Stanley's comic Freefall. It has been one of my greatest joys. And Florence Ambrose has always been my inspiration and model for what a female anthro canine should be. And Freefall is one of the things that Tugrik supported, and gave a home to on the net."
Lux_Aeterna barks, "And for that, I can only say, Thank You."
DanielCervus walks up and lights up a candle for Tugrik (here and IRL).
Lux_Aeterna gives Tugrik a respectful nod, and runs a paw lightly through his fur
K'has says, "Thank you.  The next speaker is  Twopaw,  --followed by Revar, Arcturax , Kratsminsch, Shania, Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula."
Lux_Aeterna barks, ""Thank you, for everything you have done for all of us. We miss you already.""
Lux_Aeterna tears up and goes to site back down
DanielCervus nods and returns.
Twopaw gently, mightily muzzledips. "Danke, K'has, and good group in gestalt." He lumberpads up to the dais, quietly noble, savage me.
Endy hugs Lux. He hasn't done that in a long time.
Twopaw he. 
Micole has connected.
Micole has disconnected.
Twopaw begins, in his accustomed wolfish bass. "I never know how to say good-bye very easily, or maybe even how. Tugrik was a giant I gazed at, like so many here when I got into the fandom."
Micole chirps, "I think this link will be better"
Judas teleports away.

Guest1 has arrived.
Lux_Aeterna hugs Endy!
Twopaw rumbles, "And I don't forget people. Names, often enough. And Tug, well, he never forgot me. I think he remembered my name often enough, IC. I doubt we ever knew our given and surnames, but that wasn't what he showed me, like the family of friends I see in no small part around me."
Wesley leans up against Lux and drapes an arm over her shoulders.
Twopaw adds, "This place is a dream, given form. Not quite Babylon, but Babel? I can see that. It's a place where dreams become whole, where they have names but the ones we give them, assign purpose, the power of context meshed with tonal brilliance."
Hella smiles.
Hella leans in against Zrath and squeezing his hand.
Hella also pulls Jean into the cuddles too..
Jean-Renaud is tugged over. Hugs.
Sebkha has connected.
Sigwion nods to Twopaw's description...
Sebkha has disconnected.
Twopaw adds, "Maybe that's why we're all storytellers. We are all stories, told in the footpath we set down before us, the linear foot of our tale left behind. And we leave behind not body, but soul. We're not gone, whether our parting is brief in delay or vast in extremity: our story is as long as our lives are."
Twopaw hurrfs, "And share that tale, in a world full of people, social animals of every stripe; in our hearts, in this place of dreamlines shaped into flesh, or out there in the world where our bodies are shaped by the soul of the world we're born into. Humanity is about choice- and we choose to boldly be, and boldly go."
mejeep has arrived.
Twopaw adds, "I once stood on the shoulders of giants. And we're all giants, waiting to grow up- but do we ever? Not 'til our tail is done."
Dragon has connected.
Twopaw chuckles, "And we all have a little Vorlon inside us. <wink>"
BoingDragon hehs.

Peggy pfffff.

Niko chuckles gently.
Twopaw adds, "To wit, and to witness my beloved friend, a quote from a story I helped to tell, a proverb. Two, I'll cheat: "Death, like solitude, is impermanent."
Twopaw adds, "The second: A name should not be a burden poor, but its spoor define your foundling path."
Samantha_Indigo has disconnected.
Twopaw leans down, and wolf-kisses Tugrik's snout. "Take care, good chummer. We've got this, because in here," he touched his heart, "there we are."

Endy eyes Ashryn. Is she the one he knows, or did she have two N's?
Dronon has disconnected.

Ashtoreth says, "Dude, don't remind we we're old. <3"
Ylana smirks.
Revar says, "I first ran across Tugrik on a small server named Islandia, if I recall correctly, back in 1990 He was a friend I'd occasionally hang out with, and later on on CrossRoadsMUCK and eventually FurryMUCK.  I first met him in person at Confurence II, and he was a fun person.  Somewhere around 92 we both ended up in the San Jose bay area, and got to hanging out more. When I moved out of the Voops-N-Lupes household, he moved in and took my old room.  Some years later, I was looking to move again, and he had a house he was renting, so I moved in.  That was, I believe 1999.  I have been house-mates with him ever since.  That's 25 years, plus some."

Miell softly says, "I remember you boing a housemate back in '97 when I first moved down to San Jose, Revar.  So perhaps a bit earlier?"

Warphammer has arrived.
Hrral bows out quietly, but appreciates that all could be here for this moment of rememberance.
Revar says, "I know it may come as a surprise, but I'm not the most sociable bat in the world.  Something something five-pointy-ends.  Tugrik, however, definitely was.  And he'd end up dragging me into all kinds of projects.  We did photoshoots for Sci-fi and furry conventions.  We did Burning Man in '96, and a number of years thereafter.  We did art cars like the Hungry Hungry Hippo cart."

Andiron has arrived.
Revar says, "We had a makerspace shop in which we did woodworking, metalworking, 3D printing, even etched circuit boards, and helped out other folks with their projects.  Tugrik was one of the good ones in the Maker community.  He built one of the very first WiFi to cellular hotspots, and a bit of his code is in pretty much all the hotspots built since."
Maxie smiles, remembering tales of Monoceros Media.
StephenQuoll still has his fursuit badge from then!
Wesley has disconnected.
Kitsumi remembers the maker space, Tugrik printed her first giclees there ;-; !
Revar says, "We even did silly things like making a Nuka-Cola machine, complete with glowing Quantum bottles.  We built a Laser Turret to point out stars, planets, and Irridium Sattelite flares.  And he did a lot of the work on these himself.  He designed circuit boards, and all kinds of stuff.  Tugrik loved gadgets.  He loves helping other folks to use them to make their lives better or more interesting."

Glumilan's ninth hisses, "Hello, Revar. It's been a long time, but we remember the joy he took in sharing his gadget discoveries, and making them work for other people, not just himself. That house was packed floor to ceiling with them, and we marveled that they all had a function, not just sat around as collectables."
Revar says, "I think Peggy mentioned him as being a hacker ronin.  This is more true than you might think.  I remember there was one time that we were at a resturant talking about something techy or another, and he got pulled aside by another customer, to offer him a job.  A job to recover a bunch of data from a company that was in duspute over ownership.  Total cyberpunk cloak and dagger vibe.  So he did a weekend job and did his thing."
Peggy says, "I *knew* I was conflating two stories there. Thanks for correcting that."
Revar says, "Apparently he was woking for MC Hammer's wife or significant other or something.  He had a bunch of burly men acting as bodyguards while he did his thing."
Revar says, "Totally fantastical larger than life.  But larger than life was kind of Tugrik's thing."
Malachi has arrived.
JackRabbitson harms. Where IS Dusty, anyway? 
Drew says, "Dusty lives in San Jose, still."
Revar says, "I've known him for a long time, and he was my best friend.  He made my life better, and brought me out of my own shell a lot.  I will miss him awfully."

He came to our channel and also ran a "Dragonfire Cooking & BBQ" group on telegram where we shared recipes."

Arcturax chirps, "He was no outsider, he was that kind of guy who just came and felt like he had been there all along. He even got a group picture with our characters just a few years ago, doing one of the things he loved best, fun times and tasty food with good friends."

Bandit made burnt ends for dinner tonight. Best way I could think of to honor him.
Arcturax gives a bow of his head to Turgrik and steps down back into the crowd.

Kratsminsch says, "I never met Tugrik. There was an almost, but that's not important. "
Kratsminsch says, "I didn't realize Tugrik ran a Fidonet Furry BBS. I did too, in the early mid 90's. Most furry Groups, like the round robin storyboards, weren't on Fidonet itself.Those were reserved for Furnet and Purrnet. I wonder if I ever Role Played with him there."
Kratsminsch says, "There was a time when Toast was mayor, and they decided to hold a fresh election, so I threw my name in. It was either the announcement or the voting form listing candidates that had an error."
Kratsminsch says, "Tugrik apologized for misspelling my name. It wasn't important, so we ran with the alternate spelling. I tried not to give Tugrik or the other wizzes any trouble. Maybe only a little trouble. Certainly not Revar!"
Axiom goes home.
Axiom has left.
Kratsminsch says, "That's all I can think of to say about my interactions with Tugrik. I hope some of it was relevant. How are we going to gather up the loose ends like Freefall and Furrymuck itself? His name should stay on those as part of his legacy."
Kratsminsch looks for a place to hide
Prawica remembers that election, she tried to run as the Silly Party nominee.

Prawica errr, Anja did.
Kaliffio says, "Was that the one where I did the Mayoral race with the automated colored buoys?""
Indi says, "I think I joined up here during that election or shortly after <3"
K'has says, "Thank you.  ***If you are one of the ones capturing a log of this, please put a link to the file (when it's ready) on the Park board.  Many folks have been requesting this. **The next speaker is Shania,  --followed by Siege. Boingdragon, Ashryn, Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole"
Shania says, "Thanks K'has.""
Shania says, "I first met Tugrik when he was living with  a group at Voops and Loops.  At the time, I was quite nervous about anything furry related and those strange fans.  Tugrik set me at ease almost instantly.  His demeanor and kindness were evident from the very first.   More over, he was *authentic*, in a way that I rarely see in people.  Did I say rarely?  Maybe never. Certainly not back in the 90s.  In some ways I was jealous of him, simply because of that."
Shania says, "He was a gregarious and social soul in a fandom of people who were often unable to deal with regular social norms.  He was a generous and kind individual in a fandom that could be xenophobic and suspicious of outsiders.  And whether it was paying for an entire T1 on his own to run FurryMuck or founding a Workshop/Makerspace for everyone to use and printing art for artists... he was always lending a helpful paw.  "
Shania says, "Sometimes people took advantage of him.  Maybe not maliciously, mind you. Someone who gave so much of themselves was bound to run into a bad apple or two.  He never let situations like that change him.  He just picked himself back up and galumphed onwards with nary a growlf."
Shania says, "And my, was he sharp.  I was always humbled by his knowledge and technical skill and his fearless willingness to try new things.  Satellite Tracking, Drone flying, cellular telephone bridges, Motorcycle video cameras and radio... there was always something special going on with Tugrik.  He taught me to appreciate rum and BBQ.   "
Shania says, "I kept in contact for 30 years, visiting here and there, road tripping to Seattle, adventuring to the beach or to Napa... He opened up to me, sharing his struggles and concerns about health, people, the world.  Its rare to have known someone so simultaneously intelligent, knowledgeable, and empathetic.  He often told me how much he liked and loved people he knew and met from the muck and from the fandom. He sounded very proud to have known everyone he ever spoke of, especially all of us here."
Shania says, "We talk a lot about what Tugrik did.  Beyond those achievements though -- is that he just /was/.  He was *here*, he was present - both in the world, and in our lives.  He was someone who really *lived* his life.  Above all, /that/ is something worth remembering him for."
Shania says, "Thank you, Tug, for everything.  It was an honor and a pleasure to know you.  You were a singular and unique presence unlike any other.  I miss you dearly already."

Manitou bows his head to Shania
Jet has disconnected.
Siege says, "I'm one of Siege's headmates, not that most people here know this - that she's plural. But I had to speak, to honor someone I knew not as an in-person figure, but as a mighty pillar of furry fandom and of the collective nature of human progress."
Siege says, "Tugrik got my attention quite firmly because of his energy, when we were new here on FurryMUCK and to the fandom."
Foster has arrived.
Foster tips his top hat
Siege says, "He was calm, friendly, and larger-than-life, and a mighty strength with a reputation already present in late 1994/early 1995. When he showed up to WCOTP or another place, people would settle around, even if all he did was sit there and be present."
Siege says, "The fox jokes.. I think they were only jokes. I can't imagine him doing certain things without thinking 'but that is not like how he felt to me'."
Yiffany puts on her blouse and skirt.
Yiffette puts on her blouse and skirt.
Siege says, "I personally loved his lust for life and his willingness and ability to pursue wild ideas, to stay on the cutting edge despite the drawbacks, because *someone* had to be first. Someone had to try the new thing, shake out the bugs and stray bullshit, and set things right so others could follow in and fill out the path and the way."
Guest1 has disconnected.
Guest1 has left.
Siege says, "I remember he was a great sponsor for art and artists, for makers and friends, but also a deep lover. Someone who was... always more. Even though he and we never had that relationship with him."
Siege says, "And of course, being otherkin and exploring that, we found that Tugrik, when he was willing to talk about his otherness and sense of being a monoceros for real.. that was special to us. It's one of the reasons we followed his blog on LiveJournal, and tried searching around other sites when he stopped posting there. We never found another blog for him, though I suppose we could have asked. But there, there was poetry."
Xinjinmeng has arrived.
Bandit will BRB. Relocating rooms.

Peggy nods.
Siege says, "For these and many other times and experiences, we will be grateful. Thank you, Tugrik. Ave, sancte, excelsior!"
Gryph realizes:  Tug = One horned blue capybara
Siege bows her head for a moment, then returns to her seat.
BoingDragon says, "We was technically a dragon."
BoingDragon approaches the podium and takes a deep breath.
Dinosorceror says, "The best kind of dragon."
Electra likes dragons.
Shaterri says, "(As a reminder to some and a note to many who weren't here when the rules were initially around: feel free to talk between speakers please keep silent while a speaker has the podium.)"
BoingDragon says, "I am not a gregarious person by nature. I didn't come here as a furry, and had no idea there was an entire community until Tugrik told me about it. He convinced me to attend Confurence, and even told me which connecting flight to get so I wouldn't be alone when I got there. Then he pulled me further out of my shell by inviting me to a farewell party for Glumilan(?) who was moving to Southern California to work in the game industry. We sat and watched 'Castle in the Sky', and sliced up a watermelon with a halberd while talking about portable windmills for Burning Man, and the story of when geese took over one of the entrances to the building he worked at. And of course, the cat-collar-cam."
BoingDragon says, "After a few years, I wanted his job as Building Wizard, wouldn't settle for anything less. But he was still looking at keeping FurryMUCK's map from being a mess the last time I spoke with him. He wanted to restore Henson Lake and reconnect the Greenway. It was a while ago though, so I may be confusing things."
BoingDragon looks to Tugrik.
BoingDragon says, "Thanks for making me a more social person, Tug. I'm always surprised by how much people have shaped me after they're gone, the curse of getting older. I need to be better about realizing that while they're still around. That's all I can manage right now. This hit me pretty hard. I'm gonna go lean on him now, like I used to do in the Park."
BoingDragon lights a candle with a puff of blue flame, and lies next to Tugrik so she can rest her head on his shoulder.
K'has says, "Thank you."
K'has says, "The next speaker is Ashryn, -- followed by  Niell, Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole"

Dronon smiles to a fellow virtual cartographer
Glumilan smiles, and nods at Boing. "The lochaber," says Six. "Tug put on quite the feast."
Ashryn slouches on up and clears her throat, ears quirked to the side. "I'm one of those people that didn't know Tugrik well," she says. "I wasn't planning on saying anything either but what Kaliffio said, that Tug didn't think anyone would remember him, made me think better of it."
Micole chirps, "looks like Siege has lost connection.  Boingdragon is next"
Kaliffio tips his hat and nods.
Ashryn says, "I knew him as a mainstay of the community first-- like I said before, if you exist in Furry at all, or been near it for any length of time, you just knew Tugrik through osmosis. The guy was everywhere. And none of that 'everywhere' was ever the least bit negative. Which - and I say this with all the love in my heart - is a hell of an accomplishment in a community with this much mess."
Ashryn says, "And I know me some mess, because I had plenty of my own. I don't think he knew how much I appreciated him asking me to do a badge for him. He didn't know I was at the beginning of a colossally rough go of it when he asked (though learning about him now, maybe he did; it sounds like something he'd do). That someone of his stature had faith I could do literally anything at that juncture in my life meant a lot. Like so many others, he inspired me to try at a time when just trying to get up most mornings felt next to impossible."
Ashryn says, "People like him never think they make the kind of impact they do, but he absolutely did, in big ways and small. I'm glad I got the opportunity to know him even just in passing. If people could learn to be even a fraction as kind and compassionate and *curious* as he was, the world would be an objectively better place."
Guest1 has arrived.
Bandit has connected.
Ashryn huffs. Scratches lightly behind one of Tugrik's ears and says, "You know, for a guy I didn't know well, you sure have a way of getting me all emotional anyway." She affords the shell a look, tracing strands of mane as her hand drops. "Here's hoping some of these words reach you. And I hope, wherever you are, wherever you go next, this big blue shape you loved and nurtured and dreamed to life for yourself is the shape your soul takes." And with that, she lets her and drop, and returns to where she was seated.
Micole chirps, "Sorry, hickup"
Sebkha has arrived.
Miell smiles slightly, remembering often using Tug's side as a canvas while he was idle ot sleeping.
K'has nods his thanks.  "The next speaker is Niell,, -- followed by  Dronon, Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole
Crissa remembers that, Miell!
Miell steps up to the podium, and sniffles
Peggy squeezes Ashi's shoulder.
Miell says, "As Shaterri said earlier, this hadn't really hit until I arrived here and suddenly it was real.  I met Tugrik at Cedarcon,driving up from Ohio to Kalamazoo to then head to Sandusky.  While in College I spent a lot of time on FM, and Tug was probably my best online friend at the time. He was easy to be friends with, as other said, larger than life. There are so many stories, but trying to remember them right now hurts. When I moved out to San Jose he let me have a room until I had a job and could afford my own appartment, and we tried to keep in touch, but after I left CA to return to Ohio, we slowly started to speak less and less.  If I have a regret tonight, it is that I didn't do more to keep in touch, and that I hadn't contacted him in so long, and now....Sleep well Tugrik, and may the stars now burn a brighter blue.""
Miell steps down from the podiom.
K'has nods his thanks.  "The next speaker is Dronon,-- followed by   Electra. StephenQuoll, Purrip, Manitou, Jean-Renaud, Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole
Tilead says, "https://tugrik.livejournal.com/photo/album/897/?mode=view&id=51550 - Burning Man 2007 Hungry Hungry Hippo Art Car photo w Tugrik"
Dronon stands and turns to face the gathering, holding a tiki mug with a small candle in it. "I've never been good at being social, but Tug was easy to talk with. I only got to hang out with him twice in person, and will never forget his kindness. This is a personal memory, from the first time."
Dronon says, "During Cedarcon (1994-ish?), something like 30 of us gathered at Tugrik's place in Kalamazoo, and after a day or so we made our pilgrimmage to Cedar Point amusement park. We stayed in a low-end hotel. I shared a small room that had two double-beds with Tug, Smarasderagd and... I forget the 4th person, maybe Ehlana or Mirage (?) - Like Tug, they were a bit... hefty."
Dronon says, "The first night there, I went to bed early, after carefully moving an explicit piece of Karno's artwork that someone had left on the bed. Anyway - once everyone else showed up, we slept like logs. All of us were utterly exhausted. Smarry and I in one bed.  Tugrik and the other hefty person in the other. It was a little tighter on their side."
Dronon says, "In the middle of the night, there was a huge THOOOM.  The room *literally* shook.  Smarry and I half-woke and blearily looked at each other. "Was that you?" - "No..." - "What was that?" - "I dunno..." and we promptly fell back to sleep."
Dronon says, "In the morning, it turned out Tugrik had fallen out of the bed, and was now between it and the wall. And was still sleeping! He either hadn't noticed nor bothered to get back into bed.  But the story doesn't end there--"
Dronon says, "The next night... THOOOM!"
Dronon says, "Shaken half-awake, Smarry and I looked at each other. "It happened again..." - "Yeah." Mystery solved, we promptly fell back to sleep."
Dronon says, "As it turned out, we were wrong. This time it was the other guy sharing Tug's bed who'd fallen out, who was still on the floor. That's all I can offer that hasn't been said already. Thank you."

Electra clears her throat even though she dosen't really need to and takes a breath as she walks up to stand next to the blue one.  <<They are someone I have known from afair for a lon time, originally in WCoTP comics and around the muck.. I used to randomly bother him in pages in my less than subtle way and was gently discoraged that made me back away for some time before I switched to just being friendly, mostly just using him as bed in random pages.. Over the years I got to be more friendly and even got to play once or twice, but tastes never really alined.. So it was back to being friendly mostly.. And years later, only a few years ago was when got to know him better.. When we stated to talk about tastes and things, this was after he started to have more mobilty problems and issues with typing, as seems so often with people in my life, I get to know how awsome and intresting people are just before we loose them.."

StephenQuoll props himself up, "I'm never good at speaking at the best of times. I'm nervous and don't feel I could say much that hasn't already been said, or that could convey the magnitude of feelings that I'm sure a lot would share.  But here goes...

StephenQuoll says, "During my first time meeting Tugrik in San Jose, he'd explained how the pace and stress of life was much faster there than what I'd be used to.  That people jumped between jobs and businesses rose and fell quickly.  He then ironically lost his job and had another one lined up in the same week.  He had a confidence I admired and think I'll never be able to match, but since that point managed to convince me to actually try things, and that many interests that I thought were out of my reach both physically and mentally, were only being blocked by self doubt.  Never thought I'd do bike tours. Never thought I'd be good enough to get into electronics, radio, machining.  If I'm able to pass on even a fraction of the encoragement he's given, I'll be quite content."
StephenQuoll says, "We'd been out of touch for several years until relatively recently.  Last year I intended to visit and remedy that as part of a long motorcycle trip- show up, have dinner, spend a while catching up, then get out of everyone's hair and continue on..  I ended up losing my clutch before even making it there.  My current bike in the US has a hydraulic one and I was completely lost in knowing how to fix it.  At the point where I wasn't sure if I should give up on the whole trip, Tugrik managed to calm me down and talk sense into me."

Walenka has left.
StephenQuoll says, "He arranged for Revar to pick me up, then to add a bike mount to his trailer to get everything back.  He then let me stay for several days-- so we did manage to catch up properly after all.  I was able to figure out what was needed and get everything going, with a lot of help.  The rest of the trip was quite an adventure and quite successful.  He even outfitted me with some gear that he had from when he did long bike trips himself."
StephenQuoll says, "My only regret is, I feel, not saying thankyou strongly enough, and I certainly didn't do enough in return.  He bent over backwards to help friends because he wanted to."
StephenQuoll says, "Revar is, however, here.  Thank *you* for helping me so much.  But thank you even more for being there for Tug for so long.  Without going into details of the past few years, I'm grateful he had someonne like you close by."

Chip_Unicorn whickers, "Go for it, Purrip."
Niko belatedly thumbs-up BoingDragon's idea. :)
Pyat votes for the Space Laser.
Hella snortlaughs.
Purrip murrs softly, "FM was one of my first homes and gave a lot of continuity to that time in my life. But I thing the bigger gift than FM that Tugrik accidently gave me without knowing he was a gift or pointing that gist at me specifically was just being himself"
Purrip murrs softly, "Where I was nervous and twitchy, he was an active calm that got things done. Where I was shy and hid in work, he showed how to use work to connect to and crreate community. Any time I now joyfully start spec'ing an issue so I can gleefully tackle it I am gratefully taking some of him forward in my life"
Purrip murrs softly, "The way he got things done was approachable. The couches he wanted didn't exist? Make them. Nukacola refit before wrappers were a thing? Playful. I don't have some badges I need? His workshop can help me make them."
Purrip murrs softly, "I am gutted and startled at how much I am missing him. How much I have been crying. But if I didn't take the time to get over being shy and to be more of a friend before, I can honor him by trying to be the kind of maker he might like to collaborate with."
Purrip murrs softly, "That, and I am eternally grateful for his kindness to Tannahill and me needing sanctuary for our cats."
Purrip passes Tannahill to cheek mark them on her way to sit back down and return to listening.

Shamus bows and takes his leave.
Manitou takes a deep breath "I knewTugrik better at cons than I ever did on Furrymuck, and met him doing the fursuit photos at a Further Confusion con. I will never forget and always remeber your kind heart, your willingness to help others, always making newcomers feel so welcomed, you taught me so much about the amazing world of Furrymuck" He looks out to everyone present. "Remember his kindness, his big heart. May he live forever in our memories as we laugh and smile on how he touched everyone that had the honor of knowing him." He places a paw against him. "Ve en paz, nos encontraremos de nuevo, mi viejo amigo (Go in peace, we will meet again, my old friend). He lifts his head letting the wolf within hisself to let out a deep mornful howl into the night to honor Tugrik and to hope his memories live on forever. Take a moment lower your heads and close your eyes, remember howTugrik made you feel welcomed, feel part of this amazing world, or how his jovial demeanor touched so many here on Furrymuck and in RL. Tugrik will not only be a story, but a legend to everyone that knew him.

K'has nods thanks.  "The next speaker isJean-Renaud,  -- followed by , Chipotle, Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan
Siege says, "Electra, if the art you're talking about is already posted on Tugrik's FA, there seems to be a decent amount of exposure there in the past couple of years"
Jean-Renaud nods to K'has, ears perking up. He pads up to the podium, stepping up and adjust his tie, speaking, "I'm speaking for two reasons, one being by the request of Rabbi_Tom, who is stuck at work and regretfully cannot be here tonight. He wishes to offer his condolences, and, for those who follow him, you have likely seen the full-color tribute that he posted for Tugrik on FurAffinity three days ago. A link to said tribute is here." And he pulls it out of a pocket in his jacket and shows it for all to see: https://www.furaffinity.net/view/61824247/  He then continues, "As for my second reason,  though I did not know him personally, I knew of Tugrik for a long time, through Rabbi's art and the art of others. And the few times that I saw him out in the West Corner of the Park, he was always a striking sight and a warm presence. He was always cheerful and kind. Always very professional to deal with when I had a problem that needed fixing....
Jean-Renaud he continues, ...Furry Muck has been a home to me since 1999 and I have made many friends here over the years. A few of whom I still know today. Some Ive even met in the great RL. Ive had a great many conversations here, participated in a great many roleplays, and I am forever grateful for the part that he played in making it all possible by building and maintaining this place. His presence was felt everywhere, and its clear how many lives he has touched over the years. How much joy he has brought people, and how much sorrow can be seen in his passing. I was in loose contact with him in social media and he had expressed some interest in having me draw a commission for him, and Im sad that it never came to be. It would have been an honor. I wish I had the chance to know you better, but today, in all of these stories, I did get to know you very well. Now that youve left this stage to chase the sun into the west, and then to the path to the great beyond, I thank you for all of this. All of these friends. Well all remember you. Goodbye.
Jean-Renaud then steps down from the stage, taking a slim white candle from the inside of his jacket and lighting it with a gentle snap of his fingers, and sets it upon the shrine, bowing to the dragon there, resting in state. Sleeping in the light. And then he moves back to the line where he had been standing, falling back into place.
Maxie hugs Jean-Renaud.
Dronon wishes he still had it, but in some forgotten zine, Rabbi_Tom had done a super-quick sketch of Tug, more human but with his monoceros head, and with a few simple lines had managed to capture his essence.
Jean-Renaud hugs Maxie right back
JackRabbitson hugs also his fellow bunn
Hella hugs Jean-Renaud!  He thumps his foot happily and returns the hug!
K'has nods thanks.  "The next speaker is Chipotle, -- followed by , Maxie, Indi, Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan
Jean-Renaud hugs Jack and also Hella, smiling
Electra looks at Siege. About a third is posted to FA? 
Chipotle stands, rubs her ear. "When I lost my job out in Florida and considered moving to Silicon Valley in 2002, Tugrik offered me a place to land -- he gave me space at his house without charging me rent until I found work. We stayed housemates for over five years. In a real sense, I wouldn't have the life I have now without him -- both my career and the friends that I found, including my writing group."
Chipotle says, "Just about everyone who's met him noticed -- and, tonight, they've repeated -- how he threw himself full-bore into everything he did: audio equipment, computers, barbecue, tiki drinks. It was always amazing to be around him, or just in his orbit."
Chipotle says, "I didn't keep in touch as well as I should have when I moved out, and all but lost touch completely after he moved to Portland -- although we did meet up there, once, and went to a tiki bar together with Revar. I'm not too far off from retirement age myself now, and there's a good chance I'll end up in Portland myself in a few years. I knew he'd been having progressively worse health problems of late, but I took it for granted I'd see him again."
Chipotle closes her eyes. "I don't have much more that I can say. Even if we'd grown distant, he was a good friend, a solid friend. I'll make a mai tai in your honor, Tug. And I'll miss you."
Chipotle gives Tugrik a gentle hug, and takes a seat again.

Maxie stands up and approaches the podium.  He pauses for a moment, then says, "like others have said, I did't know Tugrik as well as some- mostly we talked on here, and we mutually-friended/followed on LiveJournal, then Twitter until... yeah... and then we moved on to BlueSky.  I followed a lot of his doings over the last couple decades, and we spoke about projects now and then, but I suppose the biggest mutual overlap of interests and activities was photography.  I always tried show him the neatest picture I'd taken since the last time I'd seen him, and we'd often talk about things photographical.  He loaned me one of his fancier light meters once- and in fact, I still have it.  In 2021 he invited me out to visit him, and even offered to pay for the airfare out there, but for a few reasons I didn't end up going.  The biggest was that by then his health issues were mounting and I didn't want to take the chance that I'd get exposed to COVID on the way and bring that into the lair.  I figured I'd get the chance another time, under better circumstances, you know?"
Maxie says, "I can't even put a value on the friendships I've made and adventures I've had around here, in no small part due to his dedication and work to keep this place- this COMMUNITY- going.  It'd be hard to ask for a better legacy."
Maxie says, "The day after his passing, I was treated to one of the most epic sunsets I've seen in years.  I took a three-shot panorama of it, and for a moment I thought of what I'd say when I showed the resulting image to Tugrik- probably that I wish I'd had a wider lens (and maybe a tripod) with me at the time.  But only a moment later, I remembered- that's a conversation we'd never get to have.  That's when it really hit me."
Maxie says, "A blend of the brightest of reds, but also the deepest of blues blues- the first sunset after he was gone: http://otto.twu.net/photos/weather/sunset_panorama_2025-08-01_01_3000.jpg "  He sighs and turns to the Monoceros.  "That one's for you, Tugrik.  Farewell."
Maxie makes his way back to the assembled crowd, pausing to ruffle Tug's mane one last time, and to leave a SafetySnak  on the stone slab.
Peggy says, "That's a damn good sunset."
Maxie nods a li'l.
Dronon whoas
K'has smiles his thanks.  "The next speaker is Indi, -- followed by  Bandit,Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan

Chipotle snugs about and heads out because it is super late for her.
BoingDragon says, "He would have printed it out."
Jean-Renaud gives Maxie a warm hug, "That is beautiful. Beautiful speech and a beautiful sunset. Thank you."
WhiteUnicorn admires the photo of the sunset.
Lux_Aeterna barks, "Beautiful. And one of the clouds could almost be a Tugrik."
Chipotle has left.
Indi stretches, and stands, taking a deep breath as he walks up. "Thank you. Um. Tugrik definitely had an impact on my life, given I've been here on and off for nearly three decades now. I only met him in person a few times back when I lived in the Bay Area, but I just remember him being so generous and warm, and I know he mattered a lot more to other folks I'm close to."
Indi says, "But the thing most on my mind now is... I was at Campfire Tails this weekend, our PNW furry camp-con, and when I was lining up for food on Thursday night, I caught sight of this big guy in a unicorn headdress, and even though I hadn't thought about Tugrik much in years, he just immediately came to mind. I thought, I think I even said "Is that Tugrik?" I hand't really known what was going on with him, but all my thoughts and memories were so lovely that I was excited that he might be back around in my space. Just remembering how he was someone you could be around, who would make things more fun, more interesting, more welcoming."
Indi sighs softly. "And then it was the next morning that we all heard from Maly that Tugrik had passed, and it was just... such a thing, such a strange and wonderful thing, to have happened to think of him fondly, just then. And I'm glad I had that thought then, and I'm glad I have this place now; I learned so much about how to build and be in community from what I saw of Tugrik and what he helped build."
Indi carefully cradles a candle as he lights it, then goes back to sit.
K'has smiles.  "The next speaker is  Bandit, -- followed by Lexa. Luagha, Vincaesula, Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan

Bandit rumbles, "I won t try to pretend that I don t have a reputation that hovers over me like so many perpetual clouds. I was diagnosed AuDHD a few years ago. That doesn t excuse my past behavior (real or imagined), but it s helped me to contextualize it. I say that because I got myself suspended from FurryMUCK for a month in 1998. Upon my return, I laid low and steered clear of the wizzes. Tugrik and I followed each other on Livejournal, but I was always gunshy because of 98. I thought that most people thought I was a pest."
Bandit rumbles, "So at FC 04, I was going around in full academic/professorial drag and Tugrik flagged me over. He had his photo gear set up and wanted to take pictures of me. Me,  that guy.  That Sunday, as things were winding down, I was sitting in the lobby area, and he sat down to start to talk with me. Internally, I was panicking.  HolyshitHolyshitHolyshitHolyshit Don t screw up. Don t say the wrong thing.  Somehow, that moment extended through the evening, into a late-night Taco Bell run and sight-seeing tour of Silicon Valley."
Hella hugs Maxie!  Maxie gets hugged and he blushes... then ah-hyucks goofily!
Bandit rumbles, "Before I was diagnosed neurodivergent, I was terrified of social missteps. Now, even more so. I don t really have friends, and most of the people I knew here aged out or moved on. It s sad that we need moments like this to bring us back together. Memories of moments of connection are all I really have anymore."
Bandit rumbles, "Tugrik looked beyond the reputation and gave me one of the happiest memories of my life a random moment of someone reaching out and connecting just because. That s a moment I ve come back to many times in the last twenty-one years. For that, I ll always be grateful. Thank you, Tor."
Bandit sits down. "Thank you all for giving me a few moments.

Lexa gets up, stretches, passes her fingers through her hair. "Man. I can't pretend to say I've known him half as long or as well as some folks, but here goes." 
Lexa clears her head, takes a breath. "Tugrik. I didn't really get to know him from here, he was kind of a legend already around the MUCK when I was active. A regular feature in a comic or two, if not even by his own designs. I knew him pretty much solely on Livejournal, so it's safe to say it's been a while. Motor_furs was the group and Tug, man, it seemed like he knew everything. Not facetiously, but for real. And if he didn't know, he knew someone who did. If you were local he'd offer to help fix up your junk, if you weren't local he had advice. And stories, road trips and projects, and kindness." 
Manitou night folks. "Thank you for coming to honor a ture legend of Furrymuck."
Lexa says, "One thing that always stuck with me, that moment that imprinted him on my mind, was a thread where we were posting about our motorcycles. He came up with a photo of the Valkyrie he had, they're giant bikes with big v6 engines, and a bunch of folks in the group could not possibly imagine how any normal human could handle such a monstrosity of a machine. At least, nobody who knew about Tugrik. He just laughed it off, posted a photo of himself with it, and said "Me and this big fat bike, we have an understanding." It still makes me smile thinking about it, and I'll always remember him in that moment."
Manitou winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Manitou has left.
Lexa says, "I said it elsewhere, I'll say it again. Tugrik was kindness and creativity incarnate, and if I could ever manage to be half that good I think I'd be doing alright. Thanks, big guy. You were one of the real ones, one of the best."

Lexa says, "I already did."
Lynx purrs, "Lexa just went!"
Luagha steps up to the podium.  "We were there in the early days of furry and the internet, and because the circles were small, we moved in the same ones.  As you might guess, we shared a love of horses and unicorns and of course the best Technohorse of them all, Thirty-Thirty.  We may even have been roommates at one of those early conventions, packed however-many to a too-small room.  He was always there for others, and I'm very glad to hear that he had someone there for him when he needed it."

Lexa winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Lexa has left.
Electra goes quiet again.
Luagha says, "All the things that he did and enjoyed would be too much to cover and I thank everyone who knows so much more.  I'll mention that while his play and chat on Furrymuck was extensive; he was also very happy with his play on a Pern-mush, where he played a runner-beast - a Pernese descendant of Terran horses; naturally long-legged with coarse, shaggy hair.  Of course, runner-beasts can't talk, so he was more of a presence in roleplay scenes; cropping grass, accepting treats, and hauling heavy objects as needed.  Perhaps his heaven is at least a little bit of that, along with everything else."
Luagha says, "If you want to remember him, pop open a can of Hawaiian Punch Fruit Juicy Red and have a sip; and play an episode of Bravestarr with a lot of Thirty-Thirty.  Remember wondering how Thirty-Thirty's fingers would fold into hooves, and that wonder is a part of Tugrik.  Along with taking up space, and making it Blue.  "
Luagha sits back down.
BoingDragon still has a bottle of ale brewed somewhere.
Kaliffio nods to Luagha. "I would not be furry, if not for you and Jareth. And he played my character's brother on Pernmush at one point as well."  
K'has says, "The next speaker is Vincaesula,  -- followed by Ashtoreth, Spotweld Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan, Crissa"
Vincaesula walks up to the front, in her usual four-pawed stride, tailtip twitching as she thinks, and hopes she's not breaking protocol.  in memory of past interactions, she takes a few fast strides and leaps up atop tug's head, turns and curls up tightly in a catloaf, making a perfect spotted fluffy hat fur big bloo, as she often used to. she's a bit choked up, as it's last time, yet still wishes to share. after a brief moment, and a big breath, she continues...
Pyat squeaks quietly. "Thank you to everyone who has spoken or will speak tonight. I must sleep, and then continue my quest to sign every bulletin board on the MUCK in the morning."
Pyat teleports away.
Pyat has left.
Vincaesula purrs, "i want to mention my favorite pictures of tugrik, probably bc of how it sticks in my mind. i saw an artwork of tugrik (in fursona) with his chickens all perched all over him. such small birds in comparison to big bloo. and all sorts of SQUEE!!! then i was shown the rl picture of tug with his rl chickens perched all over him. (even more SQUEE!!!)  Oh it was surprising to see the scale was not so different. and the birds and tug were so obviously happy hanging out (and perching) on him. it's such an example of the trust he exuded, and others in him. that has never been easy for me, but was with him. I'm grateful for that, too."
Vincaesula purrs, "i have many happy memories interacting here on fm. I found my people here, and never had that before. many friends and aquaintances, and i know tug had a lot to do with creating this place, and for that i am ==forever== grateful. I met tug for the first time in the wcotp. being a leopard, so new here, and still nervous about being around so many i didn't know, i played my fursona as best i could, and seeing how big tug was, immediately took the best lookout available. he very politely let me know it's best to ask before jumping up on somebody before you do, so i apologized, he took it in good stride. afterward, there were so many times to get monocerous snooffled, and was proud to hat tug every time i saw him. each time was special; a tribute to his being. such a jovial, welcoming, and caring soul, i am very proud to have known him. he will be greatly missed. "
Vincaesula swallows hard, stands up on her four paws, leans over, looking into that face from the perspective she remembers so well.  closing her eyes, touching forehead to forehead, she thinks to him, /i look forward to the next meeting in the far beyond. here's to you tugrik, one of the best i've ever met./ a gentle smile, wet eyes, a leap down, a pause. one last look back over her shoulder, she returns to her spot amongst the crowd. "thanks."
Hella shares the picture Vincae's talking about for context: https://d.furaffinity.net/art/tugrik/1441683409/1441683409.tugrik_tending_the_flock.png
K'has smiles his thanks.  "The next speaker is Ashtoreth,  -- followed by Spotweld Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan, Crissa
Vincaesula grins. "thanks, hella
Maxie hugs Vinc  tight.
Zorin purrs, "I love that picture. Seen it a few times before."
Larana sadly missed the start, far east european time zones and all.
Ashtoreth steps up to the podium, takes off her dark glasses and puts them in her breast pocket. "I've decided to type this live, so please bear with me."
Ylana says, "I am sure logs would be on offer, Larana."
Jean-Renaud grins at the picture.
Ashtoreth says, "I have a couple of Tugrik stories... they aren't mindblowingly edifying, but I'm nevertheless going to make you sit through them. :)"
Seg says, "omg that's right i got to pet the chickens once!"
Anja nickers, "Thank you, it means a lot to be able to save that image of him."
Ashtoreth grins. "The first story is about how Tugrik became a wizard. I don't know if anyone told this story before I got here, but I'm going to tell you the *real* story."
Cream says, "... well?"
Lynx purrs, "Live-typing, we'll need to be patient."
Ashtoreth says, "So. This was around the time that we officially opened FurryMUCK to the public, and Drew still thought of the muck as his property... so around this time, he gave out wizbits to people he was sleeping with, or wanted to sleep with." She winks and makes a finger-gun at Drew. "And Tugrik was one of those individuals." She pauses. "And the rest of us wizards were *pissed* when we found out. We got in Drew's face, said that we're all supposed to be running FurryMUCK together and making major decisions as a group, etc. And then once we'd vented our frustration, we had a meeting to decide which of Drew's pals would get to keep their wizbits.""
Ashtoreth says, "(yes, I'm typing live)"
Peggy snickers.
Ylana smothers a grin.
BoingDragon's eyeridges rise up.
Tricuspa nods agreeably with Boing.
Niko snickers softly.
Twopaw holds up a box of Timbits. "Some call them."
Lux_Aeterna laughs. "Anyone who doesn't behave, you're gonna lose your bits!"
Ashtoreth says, "Most of the wizbits gotten taken away. When we got around to deciding whether or not Tugrik would keep his, I was like, oh, I don't know, he seems a little hyperactive and breathless and kind of immature, is he reeeeally going to do the job? and I had doubts. But the vote went Tugrik's way, and he got to stay a wizard."
JackRabbitson earmarks?
Shaterri says, "(Folks, please try to keep quiet while someone is at the podium)"
Drew wraps his arms in front of him like he's folding them, and just stays quiet. Ooh, but that -glare-.
Ashtoreth says, "It wasn't too much later that I was talking to Tugrik, after he'd actually done the job for a while, and I told him, I was wrong, you're actually a pretty solid admin and you take the job seriously, and I'm glad that you made it. And the rest, as the kids say, is history."
Nikki says, "Wizbits, get them after they have you."
Ashtoreth says, "So I was very happy to be wrong about him. <3"
Ashtoreth says, "Story number two."
Vincaesula brain went so hs with wizbits. tailtiptwitchtwitchtwitch
Ashtoreth says, "This is about five years later? in the late 90s. I have ironically moved to Kalamazoo, Tugrik's hometown, and I'm living with Hatch, ironically Tugrik's best friend from Kalamazoo."
Ashtoreth says, "And I'm not having any luck finding any work there in my field, and the money's running out, and I make the decision to jump back to the bay area and try to get something there, and Tugrik lets me stay in his spare bedroom while I'm there."
Ashtoreth says, "I think a whole lot of people have stayed in that spare bedroom. :)"
Revar says, "I can think of a half dozen people, offhand."
Hella sotto-voces, "And sometimes at different times?"
StephenQuoll is quite grateful :)
Ashtoreth says, "I land a job in Palo Alto, and Tug lives in Los Gatos, so I have a 2-hour commute each way, by rail and bike. Four fucking hours a day, to do this tech writing job there. It was miserable. But when I wasn't doing *that*, I was hanging out at Tugrik's place, and frankly that summer was one of the best times I can remember."
Peggy says, "Aaaaawwww <3"
Merideth frowns as she tries to remember something.
Ashtoreth says, "Because something was always going on at Tug's place, and he was just fun to be around. It was basically kind of a constant low-level party. Barbecues, or getting monstrous burgers and obscenely huge shakes at Foster's Freeze... he basically set up a streaming setup with late 90s internet technology and for an evening or two I did a dumb little show with a paper bag hat on my head..."
Vincaesula jigglelaffs
Ashtoreth says, "This was the summer that Fear & Loathing came out, and we were quoting that movie at each other incessantly, or doing disjointed rambles in Dr. Evil's voice. Farix and Frang were there a lot of the time-- I think Farix was Tug's roomie at the time? I mean he was there all the time --and there was this one time the three of them lured me into eating Dave's Insanity Sauce or something like it"
Hatch chuckles.
Ashtoreth says, "And... I'm a reasonably bright person, I know this is a setup."
Ashtoreth says, "But they're all like, c'mon, try it, it's not that hot"
BoingDragon says, "He did like his hot sauces."
Hatch whispers, "Ride the snake..."
Ylana >.>
JackRabbitson snrkh!
Ashtoreth says, "And I do and it's *murderously* hot, and they're laughing their asses off, and once the tears stop so am I. And that stupid hot sauce incident is like the flourish on the whole awesome experience of getting to be Tug's roomie and confidant for a summer."
Yiffette makes her own
Wulfebyte /////
Vincaesula reminded of 'fire in the butt' song. XD
Hatch notes that whisper was not a real one, just a shared memory with Ashy.
Ashtoreth says, "I could talk about how he was the ultimate early adopter, which we all know. He was absurdly generous, to the point where I worried people took advantage of him, but he was so willing to give of himself."
Ashtoreth says, "Tugrik fucking ruled, to put it succinctly."
Ashtoreth says, "And it's fucked that he's dead. It's insane! He was younger than me! and yet here we are."
Points will drink to that.
Vincaesula purrs, "no one gets out of life alive."
Shaterri says, "I just found out this week that he was born all of two weeks before me."
Larana recalls seeing photos of new chilli growing room a while bck, it looked quite the setup.
Dronon says, "Cheers. for as long as we are"
Revar mutters, counting quietly.  "8... 10... 11..."
Kaliffio had a bottle of Dave's Insanity Sauce in his cabinet earmarked for his mom when she came to visit.  She asks how he's doing every so often.   
Shaterri says, "We should probably rein in a bit, though, since there are still several people who would like to speak."
Ashtoreth says, "It's another cliche, what they say about living your life as fully as you can, like you're gonna die tomorrow, but that's what he did. Grabbed every bit of eexperience and pleasure he could from life, always hip-deep in his passions and obsessions. Ah, anyway now I'm rambling."
Kaliffio nods.
Bandit drops a double shot of Zzzquil and needs to sleep. 2am. Thank you all for sharing time with me.
BoingDragon says, "I remember him telling me about the chili store with some absurdly hot sauce encased in lucite."
Ashtoreth says, "I'm going to miss him."
Ashtoreth says, "Thanks."
Ashtoreth lights a candle.
Zorin purrs, "<3"
Chip_Unicorn whickers, "Thanks, Ashtoreth."
Maxie grins.  He has some Dave's Insanity Sauce of his own, largely because of Tugrik.
Umeko says, "And yet you still never try any, Boing!"
K'has says, "Folks, there are others wanting to speak.  Please keep the conversation to whispers."
Luagha applauds and bows his head.
Dronon says, "Thank you, Ashy!"
SpotWeld barks, "Great stories"
Kratsminsch says, "I've had dave's Insanity sauce"
Electra smiles at Kaliffio. Mothers who ask about your crazy furry friends are always good.
Bandit winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Bandit has left.
K'has says, "The next speaker is Spotweld   -- followed by Micole, Anja, Seg, Glumilan, Crissa"
Zrath-Smiley says, "Thank you Ashy. And great to see you again."
Ashtoreth smiles.
SpotWeld steps up to the podium and takes a breath. 
Ashtoreth nudges Drew and grins.
SpotWeld barks, "Tugrik was truly an avatar of generosity. I got to know him through here on FurryMuck and through his LiveJournal blog.  In the early 2000s I was the gaming director of FurFright and I wanted to make  the con experience something special. I had seen some of the wonderful things created at Monocerous Media and I asked Tug, if I could make a solid model of something, could you use your later cutter to make it from acrylic?  He could. And then some. He took my rough idea and refined it, and then just made it happen. Gorgeous crystalline tombstones. Not just one, but a full set so I could award 1st - 3rd places. Through his giving spirit he made it easier for me to be giving as well.  And that is something I will always remember. Tugrik let his heart ripple outwards. Just everyone else be as beacon as well. "
SpotWeld barks, "He was so encouraging as well. My wife Tabbiewolf was also enjoying chatting with Tugrik. He had traveled much and was as much a nerd in general as the rest of us. Slightly more recently I had introduced to Tabbie to a few old school animes; including Lupin the III. As she got interested and started going down the rabbit hole, Tugrik shared and encouraged that joy.  She's gone on to make fanzines and help build new fandom spaces for that interest (with a reasonable about of furry overlap. ) Tangent to that, we thought about taking a trip to Japan, and Tugrik encouraged both us in that as well.  Travel became chaotic for a while, but we that encouragement buoyed us.   But we will be traveling to Japan in the coming month and while there toasting to him in his absence. "
SpotWeld barks, "Tugrik earth and generosity will always radiate outward. From me, from everyone here, from everyone beyond us that we've helped in turn.  "
SpotWeld barks, "Thank you Tori..  you will be missed, but never forgotten. "
SpotWeld places a small candle at the shrine, pauses in silence, and returns to his seat. 
Zorin gets up, "I must unfortunately head out for the night; it's super late here. This has been a wonderful memorial; ya'll are the best. Tugrik was so loved. I'll stay logged in and catch up with the log tomorrow. Goodnight all."
Vincaesula purrs, "sleep well!"
K'has says, "Micole seems to be idled... Anja, Seg, Glumilan, Crissa are the last ones.  Anja?"
Xinjinmeng has disconnected.
Zrath-Smiley just remembered he has a little can of premixed Mai Tai in his fridge. Time to drink it!
Anja nods, stepping up. "Bear with me, I was going to try to write something out but the words wouldn't come. Just gotta wing it."
Micole chirps, "NOPE!"
Dronon jumps!
Ylana squeak.
Anja nickers, "Ack! Are you ready?"
Micole moves to the podium quietly, her big form moving lightly, almost like a balloon of fluff.  She looks around and sighs.
Micole chirps, "I may not know Tug as long as some folks here, 20+ years or so.  I got into FM in the third wave or so 1995, from BBS nets. By the time I got in there were people waiting for me.  I met Tug in person before I ran into him on FM.  I seem to remember giving a hug that lifted him (a little) off the floor and that scared him as Im 52 to his (to me) 7 frame.  We were friends of friends  my philli friends lived with him for a while until they got their own home."
Micole chirps, "But I remember Burning Man 2000, where we camped together under a Geodesic dome, with his weather station and wind driven power.  I painted his face in a maori/digital design and painted his eyelids with eyes.  He loved it!  I have other memories of talking, creating, and sharing our stories. I make the label for his Red Panda Red Red birtch beer. I never opened mine, but Im told it was yum!"
Micole chirps, "When he moved out of the bay, I lost track of him, to my sorrow.  But I did manage to draw the big blue, which I am happy.  Fly Free Tori."
Micole chirps, "When he moved out of the bay, I lost track of him, to my sorrow.  But I did manage to draw the big blue, which I am happy.  Fly Free Tori."
K'has says, "Thank you."
K'has says, "Down to the final four:  Anja?"
Kaliffio says, "It's like Survivor, or the Amazing Race, but we all win by knowing Tug."
Corwyn nods.
Micole places a tiny (for her) purple candle on the area and leaves as qyietly as she came
Argentilane lilts, "And lost, greatly."
Raoul needs to step out. But this has been a lovely memorial. Tugrik meant so much to you all, it's genuinely touching. Be well, everybody.
Anja nods. "I don't remember what drew Tugrik to start a friendship with me here. I was pretty much just another face in the crowd: made a few friends, got in some stupid arguments, the usual."
Hatch excuses himself.  It's late and they have an early morning.  Thanks all for the kind words about our dear friend.
Hatch goes home.
Hatch has left.
Luagha has left.
Anja nickers, "But when he did, he was very kind and fun to be with. And we did manage to spend an afternoon in Santa Cruz together that was quite pleasant."
Anja nickers, "We chatted, we roleplayed...and yes, we fooled around."
Argentilane lilts, "Foaled."
Anja nickers, "Aaayyyy."
Proxima chuckles....
Peggy groans.
Raoul winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Raoul has left.
KurtMRufa earswivels.
Anja nickers, "We drifted apart for a bit as his health issues made him more irregular here, then a couple years ago reconnected on The Bad Place, and then Discord."
Sebkha has disconnected.
Anja nickers, "He managed to tell me how much he valued my friendship before he fell silent. Me, a relative nobody who couldn't hold a candle to his works, his life."
Xinjinmeng has connected.
Anja nickers, "I'll always treasure that. And the piece of him that remains..."
Anja looks over to Prawica. Her daughter...OUR daughter.
Niko smiles softly.
Prawica stands up. She tries to strike a proud pose, though her body quivers as tears run down her muzzle.
Micole goes home.
Micole has left.
Anja looks to Tugrik. "Rest well, dear. Remember me, I hope we can run together one day."
Anja walks over to stand beside Prawica.
Crissa pats Anja on the shoulder and fuzzles her mane.
K'has says, "Thank you.  We're hearing some amazing stories tonight.  Final ones:Seg, Glumilan, Crissa"
Maxie hugs.
Guest1 has disconnected.
Guest1 has left.
Hella nods, "Nice to see Tugger lives on, in you and Prawica, Anja.
Sebkha is automatically sent home.
Sebkha has left.
Seg nods
Seg says, "i arrived on furrymuck in the fall of 1998, an annoying 17 year old child let loose on the internet, and i perhaps still feel like that among Tugrik's peers. every ban was well earned"
Seg says, "i would just like to say i have always looked up to Tugrik and Revar and everyone else who built FurryMUCK and kept it running all this time. i never then would have imagined i would still be logging in here, in the far flung future of 2025, a blessed island of what the internet used to be"
Contrast goes home.
Contrast has left.
Seg says, "Tugrik, you have made waves through the universe that extend forever. Rest in peace."
Seg licks Tugrik!
K'has says, "Glumilan?"
Jean-Renaud smiles
Draco has arrived.
Glumilan's fifth hisses, "Whew, okay. We're going to dispense with the collective speaking, so this is both easier to read and to read out."
Draco waves
Draco thunders, "Oh wow..." as he looks over some statues and names he knew from decades ago."
Dronon glances over with a finger to his lips.
Endy sneaks.
Endy has left.
Dinosorceror smiles at Lianna.
Rafferty has arrived.
Dinosorceror nods to Rafferty.
Foster wavies.
Shaterri says, "While Glumilan is composing themselves I'd briefly like to offer immense thanks and gratitude to K'has for organizing the ceremony and keeping the cats successfully herded for nearly five hours now."
Ashtoreth says, "Meow."
Bobcat nods. Meow.
Kaliffio says, "Yahroo."
Zrath-Smiley says, "Miaou!"
Indi nodnodnods <3
Panthar mews, "meow"
Peggy nods.
Jean-Renaud nods to K'has, "Thank you very much."
Rafferty grins.
WhiteUnicorn bleats admiringly!
Glumilan nods. "Hear, hear. Thank you, K'has."
Siege says, "mew-wuff"
Yuzuki yips in approval!
Bookwyrm nods to Ratterfy.
Maxie nods.  Thanks.
Ashtoreth says, "Jeez, five hours. That's a lot. Thank you, K'has."
Merideth titters behind her hand. "Squeek."
Argentilane notes that we have got to stop meeting like this.
Vincaesula mriaaaaooooooo
Siege <3
K'has says, "Thank you."
Dinosorceror smiles at Bookwyrm
You say, "Yes, thank you, K'has. miao"
Gryph gryphon-shrieks.  It's kind of a lot.
Tricuspa says melodiously, "So great thank you!"
Kzintosh says, "Thank you, K'has."
Dronon aroos
JackRabbitson smiles, nods
Lux_Aeterna barks, "Thank you"
Yiffany was here from the beginning
Anja thanks everyone who whispered her, you're all too kind.
Lianna nickers, "Thank you so much."
Kratsminsch says, "No, actually I was"
Blort has arrived.
Sorien has been here for most of it.
Argentilane snugs Blort
Blort wave its
Hella speaks, "Thanks K'has. You've been a great celebrant."
Electra has only been here for 4:30mins of it.
Tlancaalek bows to the remarkably resilient K'has.
Vincaesula blushes. was a lil late. thankies k'has too!
Panthar mews, "thankies!"
Points quietly says, "You can always give me the toad-wand back."
Drew nods, thankfully, to K'has.
Cream bows to K'has.
FoxAlopex smiles... "I was here for most of it... AFK for a little bit, but yeah awesome.
ShadowedSong says, "thanks"
Kiya says, "I'm grateful to see so many faces and stories here, even though I don't have much to add myself."
SpotWeld (ooc) sadly must depart. Be well all, thank you for sharing 
SpotWeld teleports away.
SpotWeld has left.
KurtMRufa nods appreciatively.
Twopaw muzzledips. "No potential Eschatons were inspired to peaceful divnity in the making of this tribute."
Zrath-Smiley drinks his mai tai and feels all warm and fuzzy.
Peggy says, "A shame, I feel like I'm about ready for this world to end."
Niko shuffles in place where shi sits, "Indeed: It's been a beautiful ceremony and the outpouring's been very heartfelt."
Blort squeaks at Argentilane
Foster says, "A million hugs, K'has darling."
Chip_Unicorn has disconnected.
WhiteUnicorn is just wowed at seeing so many names here that he remembers from the mid 90s, which feels something like seven or eight years ago?  Couldn't have been that long.
Chip_Unicorn has connected.
Proxima looks at the timer - 4 hours and forty minutes, and many wonderful stories so far,,,
Niko murrs, "1997 was just a few years ago, mmhmm."
Ashtoreth says, "Did Glumilan speak?"
Twopaw was happy to be here. "It helped. Closure, I think this was for me. I'm okay, and okay with this."
JackRabbitson takes a moment to light a candle and set it with the rest. Little to offer, but gratitude
Points quietly says, "Not yet."
Zrath-Smiley says, "I was dragged here on July 15th 1995, so I guess I was part of the Third Wave?"
Kaliffio says, "Can't be more than 5.  And no, they're still typing."
Kzintosh says, "It has been an honor to stand here tonight.  I found myself on FM, and my husband (Kamen_Kyote) too.  30 years later, I am grateful that titans like Tugrik and the others who have kept FM going for so long have done so, as well as all of the familiar names I saw tonight."
Niko murrs, "I don't believe so Ashtoreth."
Twopaw oufs, "It could've been the coconut."
Proxima harmonizes, "Not yet..."
K'has says, "Not yet."
Argentilane lets Blort paw at her safe-deposit box keys
Ashtoreth says, "Just noting that I don't think we're quite done yet."
Glumilan says, "Almost there, sorry."
Kzintosh says, "Zrath, I was July 17th 95.  Kzinti invasion maybe."
(OOC) Electra says, "Take your time." (OOC)
Points quietly says, "All words in good time."
Draco chews on some keys... mmm tasty metals
Electra was here.. Early 2000's? 
Twopaw ack! "Y'right. Thank you, Ashtoreth."
Electra steals a key to eat!
Kaliffio says, "You waited for us, Glum, we'll be here for you."
Anja nickers, "I was around mid-'90s."
FoxAlopex finds it hard to believe he came here in 96... "With any luck I'll be here a long time more, thou might've almost bit the dust last year..."
Draco laughs.
Tilead thanks K'has
Twopaw nodnods. "All good things to those who gets stuck in the avocado tumbler."
Corwyn says, "'92, in my case."
Vincaesula gonna hafta look hers up O.o
Electra peeks at.. Oh:  Created: Feb 1999  So yeah.. Keeps forgetting she got here /bfore/ 2000's.. Not much but yeah..
Bookwyrm has been here since 1991.
(OOC) Draco says, "laughs.. as he's also Blort." (OOC)
DonQuixote teleports away.
DonQuixote has left.
StephenQuoll says, "Been a very long time FoxAlopex, but I hope you're okay."
Sorien speaks softly, "2002 here."
FoxAlopex murrs, ""ex me" XD"
Niko hums, "'98..technically...but no verified email, so to FurToonia and SPR I went."
Proxima arrived on December 03, 1992...  
Vincaesula purrs, "feb 2014"
Gryph says, "It is a marvel that so many of the prime movers of the very first incarnations of FurryMuck would be at the same place and time.  Let's hope old friendships can be rekindled."
Hella's as Hella has been here since 2000 or 2001, can't recall what her character(s) were before that
Kiya says, "Only 96 here, and it feels like I got here so late compared to everyone!"
Twopaw hms. "June 1995, I'm pretty sure for me."
Kratsminsch says, "Created:     Wed Sep 09 10:20:10 1992"
Kaliffio says, "March 3rd, 1991."
Dinosorceror says, "It's amazing how many old neurons are firing."
Sar has disconnected.
Peggy says, "1995 here. Somewhere in 1994 if you count the long-since-autotoaded first character."
Hella speaks, "Created:  Sat Apr 21 07:25:10 PDT 2001"
Tlancaalek says, "June of 1998, for me.  I'm a noob."
Lianna nickers, "It's been a while since I've been around here, but August 1995 for me."
Kiya says, "Goodness knows I was far too young to be here at the age of twelve in 1996. I grew up here in an extremely literal sense."
Glumilan's first hisses, "I'm going to offer what might be an unusual perspective, as someone who had kind of a rocky relationship with him. This was during the tech boom like... how many years ago, was it? 25? This was back when if you knew somewhere betwen jack and diddly about computers you could probably land a decent job in California. I was sick of where I lived, and Lynx suggested I move down and try my hand. I ended up working for an evil overlord in the game industry. The time gulf makes it difficult to remember exactly how it happened, but I rented a room in Tug's and Revar's place."
Niko hushes.
Ashtoreth shushes
Draco's was on SPR...well on now too.
Chip_Unicorn listens to Glumilan.
Glumilan's first hisses, "The friction we had was mostly my fault. I was a prickly recluse spider who worked 12 hour days, came home, and disappeared into my room. I had a shorter temper in those days too. I wasn't the easiest person to live with, for which I apologize to Revar as well."
Draco thunders, "I had to crack open an old laptop that had all my mucks on it."
Wulfebyte growls softly, "'09 here, its been an amazing journey."
Dronon says, "Late 90s was the dot-com bubble"
Glumilan's first hisses, "Living with him, I saw many of the things that people have mentioned here... his generosity, his gregariousness, his easygoing charisma, his astonishing intellect, and his drive to learn and discover. I think he had hoped that I would be a member of the social circle, and I had seen it as more of a tenant arrangement at first, but we tried to reach out to each other. In those times, I saw another side of him. He's remembered as boisterous and gregarious, but he also had a kind of shyness to him, somehow. A sensitivity and vulnerability, a yearning for genuine connection that we tried to navigate, sometimes with success, sometimes not."
Drew gently asks pople to pause the chatter, so Glumilan and all his heads can speak.
Glumilan's first hisses, "While that yearning could make him vulnerable, it was also one of his many great strengths, what drove him to build so many important friendships and networks. He was a singularly remarkable person, and that really made you want to be his friend. And when social connections weren't as successful, he had extraordinary grace and resilience in handling those. A lot of people could be petty toward him, or imposed on him, but he would rise above it each time, moving on, always about building, about creating, and ultimately he created foundations that entire worlds were laid on."
Malachi says, "Can't say I'm much of a public speaker, but I arrived on FM in...what, '92 or so?  Maybe earlier, though under a different name.  Tugrik, Tor, Tori...was one of my oldest friends, from around that time.  A few roadtrips in his old blue Element, his van, together on motorcycles.  Visits from the Midwest to his place in San Jose, then to his newer home near Portland.  He even stayed at my place in the PNW a few timres over the years.""
Malachi hushes.
Glumilan's first hisses, "We weren't on the best terms when we parted ways, and I regret that. When we did vibe, we really did have a blast together. He showed me Tribes (absolutely kicked my ass with the spinfuzor), he showed me an entire world of electronics and photography, and the good times were really good. I feel like if we'd met 20 years later, we might have forged something stronger, and I deeply regret that it's no longer possible. The world should have kept him."
Dronon has disconnected.
Dronon has connected.
FoxAlopex is way up in a remote city in Canada so missed the tech rush. "Neat that so many of you are from around California, only ever attended one Furcon, a long gone Conifur...
Kratsminsch is pretty much antisocial, partly a money and clinical depression thing, partly a late autism diagnosis, and then there were the pet skunks she couldn't trust anybody with.
K'has says, "Folks, Crissa has waited a long time to speak..."
Glumilan's first hisses, "I hope he still has the search bead and raven feather, somewhere. Thank you for letting me into your home, Tugrik, Revar."
Kratsminsch says, "I was 40"
Malachi waits, cloudily attentive.
"I don't know much what to say; he was just always there." Crissa says, "Like, I literally don't remember our first meeting.  And Tug never made it matter.  Made me feel like I was always a friend.  And that's what I needed when I first came to Furry."
Crissa says, "Whenever the next time our schedules aligned there'd be another adventure or build to retell and show off and I was always a star-struck audience.  I hope I was the right weight friend Tug wanted.  Like a few here, I'm not... Neurotypical.  Partial face-blindness and on the spectrum.  I've always been scared of the next relationship screwup:  It always blindsides me when I upset people.  Tug said how hard it was to depend upon others...  But also, to balance attention across many people, so no one felt too much weight or attention.  There was always this crazy quiet good advice to be had."
"And always something good to eat." Crissa says, "It always hurt my heart when he confided how he didn't feel deserving of friendship.  High standards, but privately, higher for himself.  Making the world as good for others as Tug made it will be tough."
K'has says, "And with that, the service is closed."
Foster strides on over... and hugs K'has warmly.
Dronon bows his head
Revar says, "Tugrik had an intrinsic understanding of ballistic weapons in games.  And archery, RL, apparently.  He kicked severe ass with the mortars in Tribes."
Yuzuki head dips to the Great Blue Creature!
Peggy says, "Thank you, K'Has."
Tlancaalek bows his head.
Austin says, "Did want to say, Niny'ah wished to be here but couldn't get her computer to log in here.  Her thoughts are with Tugrik, though."
Lux_Aeterna nods. "I am glad that all of us could be here."
Drew says, "Thank you, everyone, for attending."
Foster says, "May I add one quick note, luv?"
WhiteUnicorn steps up close to Tugrik, and bows his head silently for a long moment.
Tlancaalek says, "Yes, thank you."
K'has says, "thank you all for coming...and specialthanks to the Wizcorps."
Crissa sighs out with a shudder.  "And yeah. Tug had that quiet side.  He told me once or twice, that's why he hosted.  So others would be able to be around... Like tonight."
FoxAlopex oops and thought the service ended already...
Chip_Unicorn grins. "Thank you to everyone here."
Tilead sits
Lynx purrs, "Thank you all for sharing your stories. This is free time now, if anyone has more they want to talk about."
Kaliffio says, "Nice to see old friends and new friends one and all."
K'has says, "Certainly, Foster."
Chip_Unicorn lets Foster speak.
Indi says, "Thank you K'has, Revar, Drew, everyone, and especially Tugrik <3"
Yuzuki says, "Thank you all creature herders for the eve"
Malachi says, "Thanks, K'has, and others."
Shaterri says, "Also, a tribute to all of you. There were literally a hundred people here that I've known tonight for twenty if not thirty years. I don't think many people get to have that kind of social history. Thank you, all of you, for it."
Chip_Unicorn goes quiet.
Tricuspa nods, "We have a reception/wake over at FAAFC if folks wish to move to another location T FAAFC, W, SE"
Dronon says, "Thanks, everyone"
Kzintosh says, "Thanks, Wizzes."
Umeko says, "Thank you, K'has.  Goodbye Tugrik, you were with us far too short."
Bookwyrm murmurs, "Thank you, K'has."
Sorien speaks softly, "Thank you to all who spoke, and to those that arranged this. It was wonderful, and as long as we remember him, he will be with us."
Lianna bows her head.
Tantari hugs Tugrik!  Tantari snugs the fuzzy blue dragon around the neck.
Maxie hugs all about.
Tantari says, "Miss you... goodbye."
Drew says, "And Dinosorceror, you still awake?"
Tlancaalek says, "I only saw him as an occasional, serene presence, but he left a remarkable array of positive memories.  I'm grateful for the service."
BoingDragon says, "Thank's K'has. It was nice to see all the old faces again too."
Argentilane inclines her head for a final time to Lord Tugril
Maxie says, "And yeah, thanks to everyone for coming and sharing."
Wulfebyte says his final goodbye to Tugrik. "The world is a little less bloo without you in it, friend."
StephenQuoll says, "Thank you all"
K'has heads to bed.  Sweetdreams, all.
Foster bows to all. "I let Changa Husky know about this. He'd love to have people help him put together a display for the Furry Family Ofrenda World for Tug."
Revar says, "Thanks, K'has."
Tannahill flashes a smile, and is gonna fall over and sleep some. "Thank you for setting this up and telling stories and everything."
K'has winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
K'has has left.
Tricuspa nods at K'has, "This gathering has been splendid.
KurtMRufa teleports away.
KurtMRufa has left.
Shanya says, "Thank you, Tugrik.  And thank you, all."
Kratsminsch hopes people who have passed are still there when the people who remember them have also passed
Blort bows to Tugriik
Tricuspa smiles at Tugrik.
Tannahill winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Tannahill has left.
Kratsminsch says, "Forgetting shouldn't mean gone for good"
Sorien hugs about. "I'll try to pop in here on FM more often.
Chip_Unicorn goes home.
Chip_Unicorn has left.
Niko stands, stretches, and looks around with a smile, looking grateful for the time and stories shared. Shi pauses by Tugrik to regard him in his peaceful solemnity...takes a small orange candle, and lights it to join with the others. A small one from a stranger nonetheless touched by association.
Anthony winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Anthony has left.
Lux_Aeterna gives Tugrik a last hug
Jareth winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Jareth has left.
Hella moves over to ruffle Tugger's mane, "Sleep well, Big Blue...ya earned it."
Qermit smiles at Tugrik.
Thumper says, "So true BoingDragon. I can't imagine a better tribute to Tugrik than having a gathering like this."
Foster leans up and hugs Shaterri just a bit. Oh, who's he kidding? *SQUEEZE*
Wulfebyte hugs Sorien.
Dronon says, "I'm going to try writing an obit on Flayra, it may not be especially complete, but feel free to chime in there. It may take me a couple of days. I'm entertaining a houseguest."
Tricuspa says melodiously, "Be well and enjoy your new journey, Tugrik"
Electra smiles a little and nods.. <<The problem with times like this.. You find out how much more there was to someone than what you knoew.. And it's too late..>>
Anja walks over to Crissa and gives a gentle leansnug, mare to mare.
Draco nods to Tugrik and says "Miss you big blu."
BoingDragon needs to remember to post on the park bb about a permanent memorial in the park
Shaterri hugs back solidly, and then nods to Dronon. "Thank you for that."
Niko steps back and makes hir way on out. "Goodnight everyone. Take care. Goodbye, Tugrik."
Malachi says quietly, "...atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale."
Tricuspa probably will have a raw log and try to clena it up with folks words and names.
Umeko bows.  Bedtime for her.
Argentilane lilts, "Idem in me."
Oliver chirps, "It is strange to watch an era end like this."
Tricuspa says melodiously, "Night and thank you all!"
Umeko goes home.
Umeko has left.
Siege says, "I believe the soul will always go where it finds need and love. So as we loved, so will we find our loves - acquaintances, friends, family, deep intimates, and more. Whether it be in one life, another after, or between and beyond."
Tricuspa pats Oliver.
Yuzuki winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Yuzuki has left.
Lux_Aeterna barks, "take care and safe travels everyone."
Sorien hugs back. "FA has a new memorial page. I told Groat about it, but I be they'll add whatever people have to say."
Larana gives a quiet nod, not one for being good to speak, will catch up on what she missed whilst sleeping later.
Merideth looks up.
Malachi bides a while.
Orrin murmurs quietly, "Night, everyone. "
Austin nuzzles Oliver.  With extreme care.
Orrin has left.
Thumper goes home.
Thumper has left.
Kaliffio says, "It won't end until none of us who are here remain.  We have a piece of him in his stories and the steps in his journeys he shared with us, no matter how small."
Foster says, "One of these days, I will get around to arranging a special Fur le Dance show in honor of Sy Sable. I swear it."
Tlancaalek has left.
Twopaw nods. "What we leave behind, is come what will may, and what dreams may come. That's the work dreamers do."
Ylana says, "We send you past the Firmament, Tugrik, with all our love."
Tricuspa slips off to be ready if folks join and will announce shortly
Niko goes home.
Niko has left.
Tcharf has left.
Tricuspa smiles at Ylana.
Argentilane has left.
Tricuspa adjusts her body for transport by concentrating and then rolling into a ball.  She slowly builds up speed and then zooms upward where a temporal vortice appears for just a second.  A moment later the portal and Tricuspa are gone.
Tricuspa has left.
Panthar has left.
Tricuspa leaves, taking Panthar with her by the hand.
Qermit goes home.
Qermit has left.
Ashtoreth nudges Drew. "You knew I had to tell that story," she says, grinning. "I'm *me*. Besides, that's how we all got together here in the first place. We were our own little fuck club." She chuckles.
Hella teleports away.
Hella has left.
Ylana smothers a laugh.
Captain has disconnected.
Captain leans back, takes off his glasses, and tips his cap down over his eyes.  He soon begins making snoring sounds....
Wulfebyte growls softly, "Drew was my birth wizz!"
Drew still doesn't look particularly amused.
Electra nods to Kaliffio. Think it was pratchet..  'Someone isn't dead until the last ripple they have made, the last preserve they made, the last bottle of wine they is drunk..'
FoxAlopex hasn't been in a major public space for years... "This is a little overwhelming...  Goodnight all!"
Twopaw is happy to see you, Ashtoreth. "I didn't think it would be here. But that's the point of unexpected kindness."
Ashtoreth says, "That's what fandom was built on."
Electra looks for the acual quite.
Jean-Renaud hugs around where it's wanted or needed. 
FoxAlopex 's collar begins to glow brightly. A second later a blue ball of light surrounds him and he disappears with a flash of white light. 
FoxAlopex has left.
Bookwyrm goes home.
Bookwyrm has left.
Kaliffio eyes Ashtoreth. "Were you the one with 'rotating pies?'"
Maxie hugs Jean-Renaud.
Twopaw nods. "The city, rock and roll. Dreams of big, bright things."
Anja nickers, "Yes, thank you all for coming."
Kzintosh teleports away.
Kzintosh has left.
Sorien speaks softly, "I think it was Drew that helped me set up, way back when."
BoingDragon really needs to find the bottle of beer/ale Tug gave her.
Jean-Renaud hugs Maxie!  Maxie gets hugged and he blushes... then ah-hyucks goofily!
Lianna nickers, "Time for bed. It was good seeing some old friends here. I'll try to be around more."
Maxie hugs Jean-Renaud!  He thumps his foot happily and returns the hug!
Matrian goes home.
Matrian has left.
Crissa wonders if any public space on Furry has been this busy in awhile.
Ashtoreth grins at Kaliffio. "To be strictly accurate, David Letterman was the one who said 'rotating pies!' I was just quoting him."
Larana would highly doubt it
Foster says, "It most certainly has not, Crissa darling."
BoingDragon says, "In the olden days, this many people in one spot would have crashed the system."
Revar says, "After all this time, I'm not sure the Red Birch Beer (with excellent labels!) is safe to drink."
Kaliffio nods. "I just remember it coming out of your muzzle any number of times, and I never understood.  But good to know my memory still works in that space.
Drew says, "Right up there with "Oh-ah", "I like ham sandwiches.", and Richard Clayderman"
Crissa says, "Those are days before I was here, Boing!"
Ashtoreth smiles at Twopaw. "I don't really play this character anymore, but I knew it was right to be who I was at the beginning."
Foster says, "We programmed in ones and in zeros... and sometimes we ran out of ones!"
BoingDragon says, "Oh, I never planned on drinking it, Revar."
Twopaw rumble-nods to Anja. "It was a privilege to be asked aboard, but I don't question it. Thank you all for that."
Mike says, "FM had all night numbers overall close to the good old days. Haven't seen it with nearly 200 online in years."
JackRabbitson hugs Jean-Renaud!  He thumps his foot happily and returns the hug!
Ashtoreth says, "I had characters before Ashy but that was back on Islandia."
Jean-Renaud hugs JackRabbitson!  Startled, Jack almost falls backward, but recovers and with a smile, returns the gesture.
Kaliffio points at Taldin. "Yeah. I couldn't decide which 'me' to bring, so I brought both."
Siege says, "150 online, and about half are *here*"
Peggy says, "There's a lot of things that come out of Ashy's muzzle that confuse people."
BoingDragon doesn't drink beer.
Austin says, "Yeah, I was kind of expecting this room to crash something tonight."
JackRabbitson hugs Maxie!  Maxie gets hugged and he blushes... then ah-hyucks goofily!
Gryph says, "I am somebody who vanishes from peoples' lives. Never been someone who you'd know, but maybe someone you'd know of.  Gave rumors and internet-truths lots of food.  If we knew each other Way Back When or not, I'd enjoy meeting who you are now."
Merideth squeeks, "I remembered that my (ic) dad crashed the muck once."
Rafferty sez, "And so it goes."
(   )
Maxie hugs JackRabbitson!  Startled, Jack almost falls backward, but recovers and with a smile, returns the gesture.
Glumilan says, "Did he come up with a beer label? I remember drawing one for him, way back then. On actual paper. Inked it, even. XD"
Kratsminsch springs into the air, and her clothes explode off her body... She goes through an interesting series of aerial gymnastics, while a new costume forms around her, composed of a skimpy sailor suit, and a bad costume jewelry tiara and wand. "Look out evil doers, I'm Sailor Krats, of the Sailor Skunks!"
Kiya says, "I noticed that this place isn't on WhereAre.  Not sure if maybe it should be?  If I hadn't spotted the note on the board in the park, I wouldn't have known where the gathering was."
Ashtoreth says, "I'm pretty sure Drew was the person who made me question my heterosexuality. <3"
Yiffany puts on her WWWA battle bikini
Taldin, whiffles quietly. 
Twopaw grins. "I know. In a way, I don't myself, particularly- but isn't being alive part of the point of being more than we who once were?"
Yiffette puts on her WWWA battle bikini
Siege offers a hug to Rafferty.
Crissa remembers Furry feelings like Burning Man does, with things going all night long, all across the MUCK, and you could never be at all the them at once.
BoingDragon says, "I think it had a goofy looking Tugrik on the label. Trying to find it."
Proxima snugs Gryph...  It's been a very long time....
Maxie nods to Siege.  "I think this is the largest 'ws' I've ever seen.  And am likely ever to see."
Gryph says, "A victory, for many, Ashy. <chuckle>"
Kiya says, "But then, not everyone who shows up here on a given day wants to have company, I suppose."
Austin says, "But, it's late and I need to get to sleep.  Take care, please, all you still-flesh creatures."
Merideth squeeks, "I wonder if he would have been amused. I don't know if I was here yet."
Maxie waves to Austin.
Dinosorceror says, "I remember you emailing me about my kinks, Rafferty.  I still have those emails."
( "No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away, until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they plante )
Twopaw mffs. "Krats helped bring me into our family, and then helped me build my part of it."
( d is harvested. The span of one's s life is only the core of their actual existence." )
Austin says, "Thanks, Maxie."
Lianna goes home.
Lianna has left.
Kaliffio says, "Nights like this at Tug and Revar and *'s place were common.  Nobody wanted to be the first to go home."
Purrip murrs softly, "it doesn't help that I have name blindness. So half the time I don't remember who I know. Not great in a text environment. Including my own names. I can't remember who I was on pern muck to try o connect to eople."
Electra blehs.. That is awful pasting quote bullshit..
Dronon grins at Revar = YOu gloriously oaded me the night of the great server takedown.  Of course I'd r
Revar says, "Red Birch Beer is more closely related to Root Beer.  Non-alcoholic.  But because of that, probably not safe after all this time."
Ashtoreth says, "Seriously. The crowd that became the first FurryMUCK wizzes were the ones who helped me figure out I was queer. I owe them a lot of thanks."
Dronon says, "I'd deserved it though :D"
Shania says, "Sense makes."
Foster hugs Ashtoreth :)
Electra nods.. But yes.. Tugrik will live on until every one who knew them is gone. And even then mmore.
Crissa says, "Haha!  I have a program I wrote to remember people's names, Purrip.  It writes down the date I met them, and if they changed it ^-^;"
Shanya says, "This is about as busy as the Park used to be.  Which, in its own way, is itself a testament."
Siege says, "I started back with the St Nicholas server, sncils.edu address, before saves spooled memory off to another thread/process. I remember the lag and the long waits"
Kratsminsch has volunteered at the local LGBTQ+ drop in
Glumilan says, "And yes, Tugrik had some kind of advanced math module in his brain that allowed him to think five moves ahead and whack you with a spinfuzor in the middle of a ski jump. XD"
Anja nickers, "Oh, I do have one other thing."
Twopaw nods. "I think Jenora helped me a lot with that, but I know she had a lot of help, with me, too."
Gryph holds up a coupon to Ashy.
BoingDragon says, "Ah, Monolith Fizz from FC2001. Big Blue Brewing"
Austin has left.
_Austin's_Tail leaves, surprisingly, with Austin.
_Austin's_Tail has left.
Ashtoreth grins at Gryph. "10 for $2.50?"
Siege says, "And this is still one of the largest number of people I've seen in a room on this MUCK at one time"
Purrip murrs softly, "Crissa, that is brilliant. But pern is what? 10+ computers ago?"
Ernestine teleports away.
Ernestine has left.
hottub is suddenly gone.
Kaliffio mans.  Anyone know where Jenora ended up? :"
Tricuspa shouts "If you'd like to join us for a casual Reception/Wake for Tugrik feel free to join us.  T FAAFC, W, and SE."  (Public-Announcement)
Sorien speaks softly, "for any interestd in where I'm at, I'm Sorien on Blusky and Telegram. So I'm still about.  :)  And on Discord likewise. "
Anja nickers, "Perhaps best left for now. Tugrik actually helped save my life once."
Oliver chirps, "I think I still have one of those in the back of the fridge."
Twopaw hehs, "I still can be clingy but at leaat I understand boundaries."
Twopaw er...

Ashtoreth says, "Yeah, Jenora a.k.a. ErmaFelna."
Ashtoreth says, "I don't know!"
Dronon says, "Jenora was crashing at my place last weekend for a con :D"
Crissa says, "Tank Revar that MPI exists."
WhiteUnicorn remembers having a wizbit early on, to work on the Unicorn Point area!  But does not remember sleeping with anyone ...
Purrip murrs softly, "hmm I think some willing victem auctions were larger?"
Yiffany winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Yiffany has left.
Yiffette has left.
Yiffany takes Yiffette with her.
Twopaw pfft. "Yeah, you know her too, Ashy."
Crissa says, "s/tank/thank."
Oliver chirps, "Probably not still safe to open."
JackRabbitson says, "HOW GOES? "
Wulfebyte teleports away.
Wulfebyte has left.
Nikki hugs Anja.
Revar says, "Eh, MPI's not the worst language I've writtem."
Blort explodes into a sparkly mess.
Blort has left.
Tilead says, "Peggy, how are you doing?"
Crissa giggles.
WhiteUnicorn also remembers PernMUSH, fondly ... and Tribes ... and chauffeuring Ashtoreth someplace after an early Confurence.
Foxiekins yirfs, "It reminds me of LisP, Revar."
Twopaw should probably say it, then. "She and I are a thing, Jenora and I. Short of it being legally binding."
Crissa says, "MPI is one of the best languages I've written in!"
Kaliffio eyes Revar. "I still have my puzzle code working. On like.. three different Mucks."
Oliver chirps, "BrazilianDreams"
Points nods at Anja.  That was not a fun week.  Best to leave it? *hugs*
Twopaw mms. "She does love shibari, though."
Purrip murrs softly, "Could the red birch be an ok simmer pot? Did it smell good?"
Foster says, "Back when fortran was not even TWO tran... and the Internet... merely a toy..."
WhiteUnicorn fallsoverthud at the mention of Brazilian Dreams.
Siege says, "Mmm. I think I might drop in on the wake that just got announced"
Larana does not have fond memories of balancing 10+ layers of {}'s
Peggy says, "Still crying now and then, Tilead. Mostly just getting sleepy, I'm in Central and it's 2am."
BoingDragon still has her redonculous building quota thanks to Tugrik.
Tilead waves to Larana
Kratsminsch should sleep too
Purrip murrs softly, "I had no idea FM people were in the Pern mu. Learned that today"
Jean-Renaud has left.
Crissa says, "It's so internally consistent, and has a glossary.  Why don't modern languages come with a dang glossary?"
Larana gives a little bob
StephenQuoll hugs Krats
Foster says, "And we did our programming by torch-light... When I... was a boy..."
Kratsminsch hugs StephenQuoll!
Kratsminsch winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Kratsminsch has left.
Siege says, "I tried a number of MU*s back when I was first finding things out, including a Pern MUSH"
Oliver hugs StephenQuoll!
Ashtoreth says, "I think it was Tug who dewizzed me when I unceremoniously retired. <3"
Oliver chirps, "You know me, you just don't know you know me."
Drew says, "Jenora's still around, though not on here. She's regularly seen watching Wolf Kidd draving live Saturdays on Picarto."
Sorien speaks softly, "I'm half shocked that the Emerald City Tavern still stands. The crw isn't there hardly at all anymore. It's kinda sad."
Ashtoreth says, "I was glad it was him."
Purrip murrs softly, "ha! I can remember mydragon's name but not my charcter's name"
Anja nods to Points. "Yeah, I think you're right."
Tantari hugs Drew!  Drew purrs warmly.
Revar says, "When I was young, we wrote our language interpreters in an interpreted FORTH-like language, and we liked it!"
C-Bot never met Tugrik... how can he be so popular?
Crissa is still amazed the muck survived having Ashy as a wiz ^-^;
StephenQuoll says, "I have suspicions. Please help them :)"
Ylana says, "I talked to Jenora this past week here."
Lynx purrs, "You probably said your dragon's name more often than your own. <_<"
Kiya says, "I'm curious how many other of y'all critters were on Two Moons MUSH...that's where I got started on the entire internet in '94."
Nikki says, "I was happy to see that an animated bday card I did for Tugrik (in Flash) still loads on FA.  Even if I had the source on backup, I'm not sure I could run the program I made them in anymore."
Points nods.  He used to work on server for for Lp before he started to hack on the MUCK server.
Shaterri says, "Not gonna lie - I have actually grown to _like_ MPI. It's a hell of a lot better than MUF."
Dronon says, "Jenora also hangs out in some macro circles, but I don't know where.  Weirdly she lives RL in a neighbourhood not far from my elderly parents."
Nikas waves, and departs. This was a wonderful remembrance.
Kaliffio says, "Use both in combination."
Thera has connected.
Nikas has left.
Purrip murrs softly, "maybe having Ashy as a starter for FM is part of the secret sauce"
Thera has disconnected.
Chareth has disconnected.
StephenQuoll says, "Go FORTH, and multiply"
Merideth hops off of Captain.
C-Bot says, "MPI can do many things M1 MUF cannot..."
Shaterri says, "Jenora's pretty active on the macrophile discord server for Arilin's patreon."
Zrath-Smiley says, "I'm Zrath on Bluesky. I'm also on Twitter, but nobody wants to go there. I throw parties here at a place called the Big Cat Club. He do Cinco de Mayo, July 4th, Labor Day, Halloween, and New Years' Eve. I make YouTube music playlists for each party."
BoingDragon uses MPI in stuff that really should be MUF, but it's handing for linking programs together.
Nikki says, "Liked it we did language forth-like write language young you were."
Ashtoreth says, "I was the builder wiz. I built the park, I laid out the main streets and did a handful of shops, I was in charge of giving out links to public areas..."
Points quietly says, "Kaliffio - were you part of the group I put together to try and get the RPI Economics department to host an LpMUD? :)"
Crissa giggles.
Twan slips over quietly to place a little candle of her own with the rest before finding her way out.
Shaterri says, "Also actually pretty active on Hatch's DJ streams."
Proxima has to call it a night - it's nearlt 1am here, and she still has to drive back to the farm...
Peggy says, "Animate can still load old Flash files but it'll bitch you out if it's got any Actionscript 2 in it. I found this out the other week when I tried to load up something from the Spumco days during a conversation about that mess."
Wildfire hugs Proxima!  Proxima hugs Wildfire to hir warm bosom in a firm Titan-Hug (like a bear-hug, but WORSE!).  Wildfire thinks he hears his ribs cracking, but he feels fine afterwards...
Dronon should sleep though. "Good to see folks again.  Still don't know how to interact, but seeing the names and the communiity is heartwarming all the same. :)"
Ashtoreth says, "I quit over the whole fucking Ratinox thing that nobody remembers."
WhiteUnicorn noses Revar's shoulder gently, really glad to see her again.
Siege says, "I have some things I've built in MPI that, while a little bit clunky with the interface, are probably some of the finest work I've done as a programmer"
Twan winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Twan has left.
Wildfire says, "Nice to see you, big sis."
Oliver chirps, "Here's to old RPI, her fame may never die."
Zrath-Smiley hugs Proxima!  Proxima hugs Grumpy French to hir warm bosom in a firm Titan-Hug (like a bear-hug, but WORSE!).  Grumpy French thinks he hears his ribs cracking, but he feels fine afterwards...
Nikki says, "I was a public menace!"
Indi's just really glad to see things happening here now like this, even if this is why. Maes me want to be here more and see y'all here more too. But now, need sleep <3 See folks soon I hope.
Shaterri smiles at Proxima. "Circumstances suck, but it's good to see you."
Vincaesula was caught up but... oh well. :/
Ashtoreth says, "Mostly because the job had stopped being fun."
JackRabbitson has left.
Indi goes home.
Indi has left.
Electra is mostly on Tapestries. But still comes here for a few people.  Has been trying VR, but mucks work much better for things..
Revar says, "Thanks, WU."
Kaliffio says, "Points: briefly, yes."
Siege says, "Of course, that was before me and the headmates split, so I had them for backup to help the ol' thinky bits work on it"
Sorien fades with a puff of technicolor pink smoke!
Sorien has left.
Anja nickers, "Good night, Proxi."
Pathia churrs softly, "I am glad I had a chance to say goodbye here.  I am alas about to pass out in my chair here though.  I can't quite stay up like I used to"
Revar keeps forgetting to put a " in front of her speech.  Meh.
Electra peeks inside Siege's.. So many systems...
Dronon has left.
Larana rumbles softly, "oh, yeah, muf is bloody awful."
Points thought so.  Memory isn't entirely shot. x.x
Electra er.. Siege's head.
Electra blehs.
Kaliffio says, "I'm still putting the extra " at the end."
Oliver chirps, "I still sometimes put a " in on Second Life.  Old habits die hard."
Shaterri says, "MUCKs have this fascinating thing where they're simultaneously both immediate and persistent. You have to _be_ there to participate, but if you step away from your keyboard for five minutes you won't have lost anything."
Points quietly says, "Batbat - apparently, my recursive MUF maze making code still works. ;)"
Peggy says, "I'm kinda surprised by how much of the syntax I remember."
Ashtoreth says, "I've still got a sleep disorder so I'm going to be up all night. <3"
Nikki says, "Or even five years.  The conversations never change."
Purrip murrs softly, "That is an excellent description and perspective Shaterri"
BoingDragon chuckles at something. At one of the last FC's she went to, Eapa was asking if Revar was single. She had a crush.
Kaliffio got called out recently on Discord for using ':poses'  in a RP server.  
Proxima snugs dear friends that she hasn't seen in far too long.  Would be nice to gather again under better circumstances - but after hearing all the tales this evening, it seems that even in passing Tug does what he alwayd did - bringing people together...
Shaterri says, "Most of the other text systems for online RP fail the first, and VRChat and etc. fail the second."
Kiya says, "I still try to pose with : on my Werewolf the Apocalypse discord, yeah."
Ashtoreth says, "Revar *is* cute. <3"
Revar says, "Not surprised, Points.  The language hasn't changed since 1995."
Shania has some connection to Two Moons.
Purrip nods "Revar is cute"
Seg says, "its really obvious when a bot connects to the muck"
StephenQuoll still sometimes does ':' in SL
Siege smiles to Electra. "We're fairly open about it, actually - kind of an open secret. Arrange a time and we might be willing to talk about us"
Shaterri says, "Cute in a... pointy sort of way."
Vincaesula hugs round. will need to catch up scroll later. luvsy'all!
Crissa hasta be up in the morning; she promised to help open the visitor center at Big Basin.
WhiteUnicorn remembers sending a valentine to Revar.
Peggy says, "Wish I could've dug up my password so I could have @named myself back to Peganthyrus though. When did I change that? Why? I don't know."
Points quietly says, "Slip won't LET me code in MUF anymore."
Ashtoreth nudges Revar. "Oh yeah! Remember when I inherited your bedroom? At Lochiel's place?"
Kaliffio hehs. "I'm afraid to try poking at my old code that i'm still carrying around, because it's self-generating object code."
Garmon purrs, "When I first came to FM, I got a tour from my good friend Unci. He didn't teleport anywhere, he could navigate around the whole world as if everything was real and physical. It was one of the most magical things I have ever experienced. That's a credit to the original builders."
Revar side-eyes Ashy.
Mike says, "So many people here that I've not seen in a long time. A long time."
Rafferty sez, "It's been a minute."
BoingDragon hugs Crissa!  Crissa holds the hug an extra moment,,}
Kaliffio says, "...I remember Unci."
Oliver chirps, "I remember you changing it, but not why."
Seg says, "thus are the days of our muck lives"
Twopaw huhs. "That like Inheriting the Berth?"
Ashtoreth says, "I'm like, this is Revar's room!"
Foster hugs around... and wavies good night
Foster winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Foster has left.
Ashtoreth says, "and I had no furniture whatsoever."
Electra nods to Shaterri.  It also gives you a little bit of time to compose and check your thoughts. Provides a way to both 'filter' and also be distracted by other things..
Corwyn waves, wanders to get sleep.
Ashtoreth says, "I just slept on a sheet on the floor, and I *liked* it!"
Anja probably *should* sleep. Doesn't want to.
Purrip murrs softly, "Bother, I should go see what Lumi is doing. Anyone know how Lumi is?"
Corwyn pulls a portable hole out of his pocket, dives in, and pulls the hole in after him.
Corwyn has left.
Peggy smirks at Oliver. "Hell, you might even remember my previous character Kelvin."
Proxima harmonizes, "Drean well folks...."
Revar says, "When I first moved in there, I was sleeping in Lochiel's room while he was indisposed elsewhere."
Proxima concentrates, hir horn glowing brilliantly.  A swirling portal through space/time opens before hir, and s/he steps through.
>>  Proxima Centauri trots out with a clip-clopping of heavy draft-horse hooves...
Proxima has left.
WhiteUnicorn also remembers typing 'WHO' followed by the first two letters of someone's name in all caps to see if they're online or idle - and, one day wanted to see if Revar was on, so typed 'WHORE' - and Chareth looking over my shoulder noticed and nearly had a cow :)
Points quietly says, "There were two of him, under a sheet on the floor - but it turned out he was just besides himself."
Ashtoreth says, "I had the one next to the hall closets."
Electra also recomends Resonite over VRC anyday.. Because while it fails for the 'step away' thing, you can at least /interact/ with people and the envrioment.. It feels closer to here..
Crissa says, "I haven't been able to walk anywhere since Riss's Run got re-linked.  She gets lost."
Merideth hugs Oliver!  He smiles at the gesture and his short arms reach out to return it.
Crissa says, "Err, I get lost."
Oliver hugs Merideth!
Gryph miss Riss.
Maxie hms.  Thinks he's only done one nontrivial thing with MPI.  The... Ulna Flute.
Bobcat sighs... Snugs everyone. Would LOVE to stay more... but has to be awake in six hours.
Oliver chirps, "I remember Kelvin."
Kysh has arrived.
Purrip teleports away.
Purrip has left.
Tantari says, "It is 3 am for me too."
Kaliffio returns a koosh from his stash to Bobcat.
Crissa has umm... Dozens of programs in MPI.
Kysh settles.
Bobcat chuckles.
Rafferty sez, "I still remembered enough etiquette to check my desc wasn't naked before I left my room. ~"
Electra gives Siege a lick. She's just amused by how many systems she knows.. A few dozen sofar including her housemate and some friends.. 
Kysh nods around.
Zrath-Smiley hugs BoingDragon!  Boing embraces Grumpy French, rubbing her tail against his back and pecking him on the cheek.
Bobcat petpets koosh. Naps.
Bobcat winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Bobcat has left.
Pathia winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Pathia has left.
Maxie usually works in Perl instead. ;o)
Kaliffio built several puzzles; he used to give them away as wedding gifts.
BoingDragon says, "Riss's Run is still around though right?"
Larana woke up around 7-somthing am when turned up
Crissa eats a bit of her donut.
Foxiekins teleports away.
Foxiekins has left.
Chareth has connected.
Anja nickers, "Heh, I remember occasionally typing QUIT when I was trying to leave some other chat format."
Ylana nods to BD.
Nikki says, "Here.  Old animation for Tug.  Was when they were building the laser tracker for Burning Man.  https://www.furaffinity.net/view/4323251/"
Ylana says, "I live on Riss's Run."
Ashtoreth says, "and then I moved back to Florida for half a year, and when I moved back, fucking Shaterri and Centaur were in the same house I'd vacated. Talk about a convergence."
Crissa says, "Yeah, it just lost some connections on the edges, Boing.  Like the links to my house."
Ylana says, "Or rather, my home is just off of it."
Rafferty sez, "Oh wow, I forgot Tugrik was one of the Burning Man OGs."
BoingDragon once had a dream about @linking things in real life.
Malachi pauses to go close up the chikkinz for the night.
StephenQuoll has definitely said 'say' on other platforms more than thrice
Revar says, "Eh, MPI was a pretty good language for it's specific purpose.  Which was embedding code in text."
Kysh smiles softly. So many familiar names.
Nikki says, "Where is Centaur these days?"
Ashtoreth says, "I dunno! I figured Centaur would be here."
Crissa nodnods to Revar.
Electra @links BoingDragon. *eyebrowwiggle*
Electra hides.
Larana nods, the brackets do delinaeate it from the text clearly.
Peggy says, "MPI and its cousin from another mother PHP."
StephenQuoll says, "Far better than, say, PHP"
Maxie nods to Revar.  "It works very nicely for that, yeah."
Ashtoreth says, "I think the last time I talked to him was in the 2000s"
StephenQuoll then apologises for having said that
Revar says, "Tugrik and I went to our first Burning Man's in 1996 with Andre Tiger.  It was the year Wired let the cat out of the bag."
Kaliffio says, "...that's an awesome card."
Lux_Aeterna barks, "I think I might stop by the wake for a bit..."
Siege says, "I've had a few dreams about MUCKs and related spaces being also real, physical spaces. Turns out some of those dreams were helping people assimilate old memories and move on from lives they've left behind"
Ashtoreth says, "I figured he was still here, being a wizard, but it seems he's been gone for over ten years."
Lux_Aeterna teleports away.
Lux_Aeterna has left.
Ylana says, "Who, Riss?"
Merideth occasionally dreams IRL of connecting and chatting here.
Ashtoreth says, "Centaur."
Ylana says, "aaah."
Nikki says, "He hadn't talked to me since we broke up.  Which is fair.  Was was 8 gallons of crazy in a 5 gallon bucket."
Peggy says, "Anyway bed for me, have a good night y'all."
Chareth has disconnected.
BoingDragon says, "Riss 'retired' from here, there was a going away party I think"
Electra looks at Merideth and nods.. Has had a dream that was all in IRC text.. That was odd..
Ashtoreth says, "Centaur. <3 He was the first guy I had sex with RL."
Peggy winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Peggy has left.
Ashtoreth says, "He was so gentle."
WhiteUnicorn, were he an emotive kind of unicorn, would express the love he feels for you all.  But being the stoic inscrutable sort, he instead just watches from nearby and nods his head approvingly, and casts a long wistful gaze toward Tugrik; and then turns his head to the wilderness and points beyond.  Goodnight!
Shaterri says, "Centaur has pinged me a few times on Discord, incidentally."
Ashtoreth says, "Made it really easy to try something that up until then scared me to death."
Nikki rubs elbows with Ashtoreth, "Me too!"
"Give Wired a break..." Crissa says, "They at least played up the art aspect rather than the salaciousness. "
Anja snickers.
Shaterri says, "I don't actually know much about his circumstances but he is definitely still kicking around."
WhiteUnicorn has left.
Ashtoreth grins at Nikki.
Lynx meows folkses and flopzzzs. Have a good night!
Ylana waves to Lynx!
Points snugs on Lynx.
Kaliffio says, "Night Lynx!"
Tantari has left.
BoingDragon mugs Lynx for choklit
Lynx jumps into a furry nothingness and vanishes.
Maxie got a letter printed in Wired once.
Revar says, "G'night, Lynx."
Thera goes home.
Thera has left.
Revar says, "Missed."
Points quietly says, "Which letter was it?"
Larana should probably have tried to find some words to say, but felt a bit awkward turning up halfway, and isn't the best at such at best of times.
Points is partial to 'Y,' himself.
Maxie says, " ."
Anja nickers, "I'm glad that most of the stupid arguments I got into could be resolved with time."
Points hmms.  That's a good letter.
Electra pets Larana's nose.
Nikki nods to Shaterri.
BoingDragon chews on Larana as admonishment.
Drew is going to call it a night as well. Things to do tomorrow from reasonably early on. Take care, stay safe, folks.
BoingDragon says, "G'night Drew."
Points quietly says, "Nothing stopping you from saying it now, Larana."
Kysh says, "Be well."
Ashtoreth goodnights Drew.
Points snugs on Drew.
Kaliffio says, "Night Drew!"
Revar says, "'Night, Drew."
StephenQuoll says, "Night Drew"
BoingDragon remembers being taken to Point's beach for a party on her 2nd day here.
Twopaw oufs, "I learned that interrupting anybody on a day named Wednesday is only a little less unsafe if it's during class. After that, all butts are doffed."
Shaterri says, "The person I haven't actually heard much about is Cinnamon. The last I'd heard he was in a fairly high-ranking position at Google but that's all I knew."
Ylana says, "I made a trinket for leaving at a memorial but put it at Tug's lair and it was all the words I really could manage.."
Shaterri says, "(Well, _a_ person...)"
Drew says, "...and married."
Ashtoreth says, "Oh boy, Cinnamon."
Points still has the said beach.
Ashtoreth says, "You know, I tell that story once in a while. Where 'yiff' came from. <3"
Draco wonders if Larana is the same from Alfandria muck 2 muck instances ago.
Larana is
Ylana eyes Ashy.
Draco nods
Siege sighs. The past ten years or so have been... wild. Discovering and dealing with being AuDHD, trans, and plural was harder than learning about the psychic and otherkin stuff.
Drew says, "Cinnamon married Keovi, if I'm to understand it correctly."
Twopaw huhs. "Was it from the castanets of the infinity snu snu?"
BoingDragon only visited the lair once. Something about an invitation to join Tug's harem.
Ashtoreth says, "I can PG it. Very simply it was a private joke from when Cinnamon and Centaur were a thing."
Crissa giggles.
Zrath-Smiley says, "I remember so little from being here between, like, '96 and 2018. I remember being dragged on here by AJ_Wolf and Mer_rark in July 1995. Then I was here regularly and stuff happened. I decided to shake off my apathy and be more active in exploratory in mid-2019. That's when I had the idea of hosting parties with Kerosel."
Larana also squeaks and pats a chewers nose. and wiggles own nose at patting.
Kiya gives Siege an elbow nudge and a sympathetic hug.
Points checks Ashy's temperature.
Drew says, "But, really, g'night."
Drew goes home.
Drew has left.
Siege hugs Kiya!
Kysh says, "I doubt many (if any) remember me, but I've been around here for three decades. I honestly had feared that most of you were... gone, at this point, one way or another."
Electra oohs.. Would have been fun to be a fellow harem girl with BoingDragon.
Kysh says, "I'm glad you're not."
Shania knows Kysh, but in another life.
Crissa says, "I met you at a convention first, Zrath!  You did always look surprised to be there, yet fit in so well."
BoingDragon remembers you, Kysh.
Oliver chirps, "I'm always surprised how many stay, if not as often as we once did.  I'm never leaving though."
Kysh headtilts at Shania. There have been a few.
Revar says, "That's how Yiff was corrupted, Ashy.  Previous to that, Yiff was a perfectly innocent term that Foxen used.  And I stick by that."
Points grins.
BoingDragon created a special description set just for having sex with Tugrik.
Ashtoreth ooohs at Revar. "You're right!"
Crissa says, "I ride a motorcycle everywhere now, Kysh!"
Larana rumbles softly, "The big blue galmph was someone I only occasionally prodded really, but nothing but pleasant memories and interactions.. there was a time I spent a bit of time in lair here a good long while ago.."
Ashtoreth says, "I'd forgotten that.""
Oliver chirps, "It was just the answer once to, "What does a fox say?""
C-Bot says, ".. that would be 'yip'."
Revar says, "Somewhere or another on the net someone still has an explanation of the Foxish language."
BoingDragon can see Crissa on a motorcycle.
Kysh smiles to BD. "I got lost in your grotto on my first day here, if I recall correctly."
Ylana goes home.
Ylana has left.
Points remembers reading that decades ago.
Points quietly says, "While recording Doctor Demento on a reel-to-reel."
Electra tends to assume anyone who logs off the muck for than a few months is dead. Easier this way.
BoingDragon says, "Probably before I added the map, Kysh."
Revar says, "I ran across it again about 5 years ago."
Twopaw knows people, a lot better than names. "Like picking out an art style or a writing method. It looks like them, to me. You know? The name can get stuck and conflate by association, like a memory hook. Mostly if that tether gets close and doesn't vary much."
Ylana has arrived.
Kysh says, "This would have been around 95 or 96, I think."
Crissa says, "So could Sammi, apparently.  So she bought me one, and I learned to ride it.  Honestly, I never thought I could.  I learn physical things so slowly!"
Gryph says, "A few people here were in the room when "YIFF" was invented.  It meant "Young Infinitely-Fuckable Foxes.""
Kysh says, "I was just a young dragon finding her way on the internet, and the furries took me in."
Nikki says, "I change names every once in a while. Spent too much time as Alendria."
Twopaw adds, "It's not predictable. But I do try to remember."
Points sits on Gryph.
Kiya laughs to Gryph, "Whaaat.  Seriously?"
Kysh says, "Furry is now my tribe, and has been for most of my life now."
Draco nods
Shaterri says, "Oh, another side note: I am amazed at how broadly the news _reached_. There are folks here that I absolutely would not have expected. Another testament to the web of connections between us."
Ashtoreth grins. "I certainly delight in bringing up all the sleaze from decades ago, but there's also a point to it, which is that it shows we were real people, we weren't just these legendary names in a hagiographic article someplace talking about the early days of furry."
Ashtoreth says, "This was our real life."
BoingDragon says, "Some of them just get married, Electra, and have kids. I really need to contact Timur sometime, ask to manage Drachenswald since he's busy with family now."
Crissa giggles at Gryph.
Electra bites STephenQuoll.
Kaliffio blames Scotfox.  He found where I was hiding. :}
Anja is reminded of the old pinball game Centaur. Had a motorcycle-taur image.
Shaterri chuckles at Anja.
Electra nods to BoingDragon.  So basically dead? :)
Electra hides.
Draco thunders, "I started out on Alfandira after finding it from Alt.Fans.Dragons usenet. I heard about furry and furrymuck from there."
Shaterri says, "I wanted a Party Animal backglass for _so_ _long_."
Points hrmphfs at BD.  What does being married and having kids have to do with anything? :)
C-Bot uses 'Yiff' in a character desc (among other shortcut terms) without knowing, it just sounded 'cool', and wondered why people started acting strangely with me...
Larana rumbles softly, "Yeah, alf was my first muck also, I think here was second."
Draco thunders, "That was around 2002 maybe 2003 or 04? I forget."
StephenQuoll says, "it means huge amounts of time pass and you don't even realise"
C-Bot says, "used"
Ashtoreth says, "The people I met at this time of my life were critical in helping me understand my sexuality and my identity and helped me become who I am."
Anja offers Nikki a fond nuzzle.
C-Bot says, "... approx 25+ years ago."
Kysh melancholy dragon.
Crissa says, "I literally don't remember how I found Furry, other than it being mentioned on alt.fan.furry and EFnet.  I couldn't figure out how to talk for the longest time."
Rafferty sez, "Same."
Shaterri says, "Oh, speaking of the Bay Area crowd: Kilroy/Freela is still around and living happily with a wife and two kids in the Seattle suburbs. We saw them for Dim Sum last weekend."
BoingDragon came, suprisingly, from alt.fan.tiny-toons in 1992. I think it was either Cyberskunk or Buster_Bunny that posted the info for FurryMUCK. And then I ended up inheriting everything Buster built.
Kiya says, "I have memories of wandering into the park as a twelve year old in 1996 and asking what 'yiffy' meant, and having people describe it in the most roundabout terms possible.  The phrase 'hot-to-trot' came up..."
Taldin teleports away.
Taldin has left.
Siege blinks and looks at Nikki. "Right! You know, I still think of you from time to time, wondering how you're doing. Maybe I should hang out here more often anyway."
Crissa says, "Which was about three months.  And then I got a character."
Points knows exactly who is to blame for himself.
StephenQuoll says, "That was a backronym Gryph, and I'm pretty sure the I was 'incredibly'"
Gryph says, "Let's see, I recall Cinnamon, Drew, Shaterri, Lance Rund, and me doing as I do: Lurking and absorbing it in, when someone made the YIFF joke.  And it was secured with: "And that's the sound they make when they're getting fucked!""
Nikki hugs Anja.
Anja nickers, "I think I found Unbridled Desires first. Shocking, I know."
Sodium has disconnected.
Rafferty sez, "I'm sorry I'm not here more often, but many of you have been very important in my life. Tugrik was, too. We should remember him but also remember each other.""
Points hahs at Anja.
Larana thinks she still has the same desc from about 2001, too. typoes and all.
Shaterri nods heartily to Rafferty.
Nikki says, "I am at least 10% less rabid."
Kysh is guilty of that, too.
Crissa giggles at Anja.  "Really?  You guys were on on Unbridled when I arrives.  I was the new mare on the block."
Glumilan's seventh says, "That's true, Rafferty. This was a sad event to come back on, but we must say, it's been nice to see so many familiar names and faces again. We're surprised we still exist, honestly. And remembered our password, somehow."
Points moves over to sitting on Rafferty.  Been much too long since he's last used him as a proper chair.
StephenQuoll nods, he's seen a lot of people he's been out of touch with for too long.  He should make a point of trying to fix that.
C-Bot says, "Yiffy is when people lay on top of each other with naked bellies..."
Anja nickers, "Come to think of it, I bet I learned about FM from Flinters/Flinthoof."
Rafferty oofs!
Revar says, "Meh.  In the original Foxish, Yiff was just a mildly positive exclamation."
Crissa says, "Typos are how you know it's your copyright."
Rafferty sez, "I still use a password that Points randomly assigned to me."
Oliver chirps, "I have mostly been in The Raccoon Cafe here, not as busy as I used to be spamming in the WCOTP constantly."
Points quietly says, "Yer welcome."
Glumilan's eighth hisses, "We remember how Raffy would give us Certs mints with ratzin."
StephenQuoll nods to Revar, "I'm trying to remember the negative words, but I used to remember all of Foxish"
Crissa says, "That's terrible, Raff."
Mishael observes that Wikifur has an article on Foxish.
Shanya says, "I learned about this place from a hardcover book in the library.  (Talk about your sentences that have died out in the last 25 years.)"
Points quietly says, "Dragon's to blame for me being here.  Kaliffio was a close second."
Nikki is one of the Islandia refugees.
Kaliffio chortles. "Yes."
Revar says, "https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Foxish_(language)"
Crissa says, "Then again, I can't remember my password at all, so..."
Kysh says, "Dragon's always to blame. And if not Dragon, a dragon."
Kysh says, "Dragons are guilty."
Electra is inocent!
Electra is pure!
Points quietly says, "91 - though my original character doesn't exist any longer."
Kaliffio says, "Dragon was my roommate in college.  I dragged him into Mucks because he was wondering why I was typing to people all night."
C-Bot actually can't remember why her player came back here...
Shaterri says, "I should call it a night myself, I'm sorry to say. It has been a hell of a night. Thank you all."
Points quietly says, "Apparently, my original concept creeped too many folks out."
Kysh laughs! Is too, of course.
Zrath-Smiley says, "I was on GEnie and stumbled across the Beastie Board in 1992. It was a furry enclave in the Comics Roundtable. Proximas was there, along with other people, including Doug Winger. Since I was in L.A., I started going to ConFurence regularly. My first one was at the Red Lion Inn, where Roy Calbeck got kicked out y hotel security for having an Acme Looney Tunes TNT alarm clock."
Mishael was on Islandia for just a couple of months before it sank.
Nikki says, "Earlier I even had the presence of mind not to spoof, "A flock of herons flying past shout, 'So long big blue and thanks for all the koi!'""
StephenQuoll says, "Ah thank you"
Crissa says, "Original concept, Points? O-o"
Points snugs on Shaterri.
Kaliffio hmms at Nikki. "But then that would have been a plot twist worthy of a red heron."
Points was a plush stuffed dragon that only moved when no one was paying attention.
Ashtoreth waves to Shaterri.
Kysh shudders.
Kysh says, "Fair."
Crissa says, "Oh!  Oh!  I remember that."
Shania is always fascinated that the Islandia refugees were 'dinos' because they've been around for like 3 years at that time and here we are now going on 30 by comparison
StephenQuoll says, "Flinters taught me what wintergreen was (because for some reason we don't have it in Australia)"
Revar says, "My first MU* character was named SunSlayer, because apparently I thought it was a D&D game."
Nikki says, "Last time we saw him in person he was telling us about the birbs eating all the fishies."
Oliver chirps, "I know some angel statues and an SCP that do that too."
Kiya says, "I think someone on an ElfQuest MUSH mentioned FurryMUCK.  I had never even heard of furries before, but I hopped over and pretty much became a furry immediately."
Electra likes wintergreen. Only spearmint is better.
Shaterri winks out of sight in the sparkling glow of a space/time rift.
Shaterri has left.
Anja scrolls through her Quotes file. Ahhh, memories.
Larana has no idea what wintergreen is
Draco head shakes thinking about muds
Kiya says, "Mind, a couple years after that I heard about alt.horror.werewolves and that was *another* life changing event..."
StephenQuoll says, "Revar, you'd know more than most that it has those mechanics if you want them"
Nikki says, "I'm not a dino.  I'm more like an ooze or primordial soup."
> StephenQuoll rolls 1d6+0 and gets 2 for a result of 2.
Nikki gurgles ominously.
Gryph says, "I have Old Brain syndrome. Wife just turned 75, ffs.  You're easily right, SQ, Sounds better too."
Points waves.
Crissa is named after a classmate from Elementary school.  "She had a cooler name.  And it alliterated with Centaur."
Draco thunders, "I found Central Mud from a book "Internet Yellowpages" before I found Mucks."
Garmon purrs, "I mentioned Unci. He was on a barefooting discussion list that I was also on. And, he has a web page for bare-pawed furries, which I came across from the links in his signature. I didn't know what furries even were, at that point. But I soon found out!"
Points quietly says, "Gryph, you're only as old as you feel.  Better yet, as the person next to you is feeling you."
Revar says, "I blame Shaterri for me getting on FurryMUCK, because we were all working on CrossRoadsMUCK, and we over-engineered it, and it all fell apart.  So Shaterri pointed us at FM, which was much simpler."

Y'all come back now, y'hear?
